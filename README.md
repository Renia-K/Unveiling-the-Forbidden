# Unveiling the Forbidden: A Digital Dive into North America's Censored Literature

## Corpus Overview

This repository contains a dataset of 46 books banned in the United States of America from the 19th century to the present, investigating the historical and cultural context surrounding book banning. By analyzing censored works, applying topic modeling for frequently used words, and evolving societal pressures, the project uncovers trends in banning, focusing on themes such as race, sexuality, and social issues. The resulting research offers insights into patterns of suppression and creates a searchable digital archive to preserve these literary works.
The dataset is designed for textual analysis, digital humanities research, educational purposes, and historical inquiry, showcasing the evolution of book banning in North America through themes such as race, sexuality, social issues, and freedom of expression, while uncovering the thematic patterns behind suppressed literary works and serving as a comprehensive resource for investigating the multifaceted history of literary suppression in North America.


## Corpus Description

The dataset includes a carefully curated selection of historically censored books. These works, spanning from the 19th century to 2024, represent diverse themes and genres targeted by banning, such as abolitionist literature, works exploring sexuality, and those addressing race, gender, or social taboos.



**Highlights of the Corpus**: 

`19th Century`: Abolitionist literature like "Uncle Tom’s Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe.

`20th Century`: Books affected by the Comstock Act like "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" by John Cleland and banned works during the Boston censorship era of the 1920s.

`1950-2024`: Works censored for addressing LGBTQIA+ or BIPOC issues, including "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker and Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe.



**Selection Criteria**: 

Books were selected based on their historical significance, documented instances of censorship, and the evolving focus of literary suppression over time. The criteria included:

`Status of Censorship or Ban`: Books were chosen only if they have been officially banned, rather than simply censored. These are books that faced total prohibition rather than partial alteration.

`Restrictions in Specific Environments`:  The selection focused on books that have been banned on a statewide or nationwide level in the United States of America, rather than those restricted only within certain schools or libraries.

`Accessibility for Extraction`: Books were selected based on their availability in public digital repositories, ensuring they were accessible for research or extraction. Data was sourced from publicly accessible platforms such as Project Gutenberg and other open digital libraries.



Each entry includes:

`Title`: The name of the book.

`Author`: The name of each book's author.

`Filename`: The name of the .txt file connected to the book.

The corpus is available in the following formats:

**Annotated Corpus File (.csv)**: Includes all the scraped data pieces of information, including columns for Title, Author and FileName.

| CSV Column Names   | Description                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------| 
| 'Title'            | Title of the book                               |
| 'Author'           | Author's name                                   |
| 'FileName'         | The name of the .txt file connected to the book |

**Visualization Outputs**: .html for interactive maps, .png or .svg for charts.


## Code and Processing

Below, you will find the analytical steps employed in the Jupyter notebook Banned_Books_USA.ipynb for creating this dataset:

`Data Retrieval`: HTML files containing book texts were downloaded from Project Gutenberg and organized into a specified directory (HTML_BOOK_LIST) for structured data retrieval.

`Directory Navigation`: For this step, `os` and `glob` libraries were employed to navigate the directory containing the HTML files. These libraries facilitated the retrieval of the books stored in a specific directory (HTML_BOOK_LIST), allowing for seamless access to the data.

`HTML Parsing & Metadata extraction`: `BeautifulSoup`, a Python library for parsing HTML documents, was used to parse the HTML content of each book. It efficiently extracted the preamble, which includes key metadata such as the book’s title and author. Regular expressions (from the `re` library) were applied to match specific HTML patterns to extract this metadata precisely.

`Metadata`: The `pandas` library was used to organize the metadata into a structured DataFrame. The metadata, including titles, authors, and filenames of processed books, was then saved into a well-formatted CSV file (Banned_Books_metadata.csv). For books that could not be scraped, additional metadata was retrieved from a separate non_scrapables.csv file. This data was merged with the main dataset to ensure a comprehensive record of all books, including those with incomplete or missing data.

`File encoding`: Encoding issues during file export were fixed as the final metadata CSV file was saved using UTF-8 encoding with BOM (utf-8-sig). This ensures compatibility across different systems and software.


**Text Preprocessing**: Several Python libraries were used to efficiently process and clean the HTML format corpus of books downloaded from Project Gutenberg and the Internet archive.

   *Tokenization*: Using the `SpaCy` library the cleaned text was processed for tokenization. `SpaCy` efficiently divided the content into individual words, preparing it for advanced analysis and ensuring that the text could be easily processed at the token level.
   
   *Cleaning & Preprocessing*: The `string` module was utilized to remove unwanted characters and normalize whitespace. This process cleaned the main text, ensuring it remained consistent and readable. All text was converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity and a list of stopwords (using the `nltk.corpus.stopwords library`) was removed from the text to eliminate common but insignificant words, to improve the quality of the dataset, ensuring accurate results in the analysis. Also using `string.punctuation` and `isalpha()`, punctuation marks and non-alphabetical characters were stripped from the content, to focus on the meaningful words.
   

`Output Generation`: The processed text [cleaned text files] for each book was saved as .txt files in the designated output directory (FINAL_TXT). This organized structure ensures easy access to the cleaned data for analysis. 

`Saving preproccessed text`: The cleaned and processed texts were stored in a dictionary (preprocessed_texts), where the keys are filenames and the values are the corresponding cleaned texts.
The processed text was then saved into .txt files within the FINAL_TXT directory, ensuring the data was ready for analysis. 


## Analysis Tools

**Topic Modeling**: 
    
    Zeta Analysis: Zeta analysis, using R software, is used to explore and identify key themes and topics across censored works, focusing on contrasts and thematic shifts over time, by analyzing preferred, avoided or common words between the centuries.
    
    Voyant Tool: This tool is employed for interactive topic modeling, allowing the identification of recurring themes, word frequencies, and trends within the texts through various visualizations, like  word clouds and term frequency graphs.
    
**Geospatial Visualization**: GIS tools [`ArcGIS` software`] are used to map the geographic distribution of banning, enabling users to explore regional patterns and historical shifts in censorship practices.

## Working with ArcGIS: Data Collection and Map Creation

This section outlines the process of working with ArcGIS and the steps followed: 

**Data Collection & CSV file creation**: 
Using the metadata from the Jupyter Notebook along with the State of the book banned, the theme of book and the reason for banning, spatial data were also collected using https://www.latlong.net/ including geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) required for the map. 

**Structuring the CSV**: 
The data is organized in a tabular structure with columns representing attributes and geographic coordinates. 

| CSV Column Names   | Description                                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| 'State'            | The state each book was banned                                      |
| 'Title'            | Title of the book                                                   |
| 'Author'           | Author's name                                                       |
| 'Year_Banned"      | The Year/-s each book was banned                                    |
| 'Theme'            | The Theme of each book based on the division we clarified previously|
| 'Reason'           | The official reason lead to banning                                 |
| 'Latitude'         | The Latitude of each state                                          |
| 'Longitude'        | The Longitude of each state                                         |

**Importing and Preparing Data in ArcGIS**: 
1. The CSV file was first added to the map project using the Add Data option in ArcGIS Pro. This made the data available for further visualization. 
2. The latitude and longitude fields are used to generate a point layer. The XY Table To Point tool is used to define the spatial representation of the data, with the appropriate columns assigned to X (Longitude) and Y (Latitude).
3. A coordinate system, such as WGS 1984, is applied to ensure the data aligns with other spatial layers.
4. 













## Outcomes 

The project will produce:

  1. A *digital archive* of banned books with a searchable interface for easy access.

  2. *Analytical insights* on banning trends and their emotional or thematic triggers.
     
  3. *Visualizations* such as interactive maps to explore banning patterns over time.
