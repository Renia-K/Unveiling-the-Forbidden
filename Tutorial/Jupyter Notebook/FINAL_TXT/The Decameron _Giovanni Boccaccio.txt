cominciò dire rustico ben veggio che il ver dicevano que valenti uomini capsa che il servire dio era cosí dolce cosa e per certo io non mi ricordo che mai alcuna altra ne facessi che di tanto diletto e piacere mi fosse quanto è il rimettere il diavolo inferno e perciò giudico ogn altra persona che ad altro che servire dio attende essere una bestia per la qual cosa essa spesse volte andava rustico e gli diceva padre mio io son qui venuta per servire dio e non per istare oziosa andiamo rimittere il diavolo inferno la qual cosa faccendo diceva ella alcuna volta rustico io non perché il diavolo si fugga di ninferno ché egli vi stesse cosí volentiere come il riceve e tiene agli non sene uscirebbe mai cosí adunque invitando spesso la giovane rustico et al servigio di dio confortandolo se la bambagia del farsetto tratta gli avea che egli talora sentiva freddo che un altro sarebbe sudato e perciò egli incominciò dire alla giovane che il diavolo non era da gastigare né da rimettere inferno se non quando egli per superbia levasse il capo e noi per la grazia di dio sí sgannato che egla priega iddio di starsi pace e cosí alquanto impose di silenzio alla giovane la qual poiche vide che rustico non la richiedeva dovere il diavolo rimittere inferno gli disse un giorno rustico se il diavolo tuo è gastigato e piú non ti dà noia il mio ninferno non lascia stare perché tu farai bene che
