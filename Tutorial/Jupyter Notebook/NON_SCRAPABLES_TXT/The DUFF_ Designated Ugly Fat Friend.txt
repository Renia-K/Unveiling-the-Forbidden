This  was  getting  old. 

Once  again,  Casey  and 
Jessica  were  making 
complete  fools  of  themselves, 
shaking  their  asses  like 
dancers  in  a  rap  video.  But  I 
guess  guys  eat  that  shit  up, 
don’t  they?  I  could  honestly 


feel  my  IQ  dropping  as  I 
wondered,  for  the  hundredth 
time  that  night,  why  I’d  let 
them  drag  me  here  again. 

Every  time  we  came  to  the 
Nest,  the  same  thing 
happened.  Casey  and  Jessica 
danced,  flirted,  attracted  the 
attention  of  every  male  in 
sight,  and  eventually  were 
hauled  out  of  the  party  by 
their  protective  best  friend — 
me — before  any  of  the  horn 


dogs  could  take  advantage  of 
them.  In  the  meantime,  I  sat 
at  the  bar  all  night  talking  to 
Joe,  the  thirty-year-old 
bartender,  about  “the 
problems  with  kids  these 
days.” 

I  figured  Joe  would  get 
offended  if  I  told  him  that  one 
of  the  biggest  problems  was 
this  damn  place.  The  Nest, 
which  used  to  be  a  real  bar, 
had  been  converted  into  a 


teen  lounge  three  years  ago. 
The  rickety  oak  bar  still 
stood,  but  Joe  served  only 
Coke  products  while  the  kids 
danced  or  listened  to  live 
music.  I  hated  the  place  for 
the  simple  reason  that  it  made 
my  friends,  who  could  be 
somewhat  sensible  most  of 
the  time,  act  like  idiots.  But 
in  their  defense,  they  weren’t 
the  only  ones.  Half  of 
Hamilton  High  showed  up  on 


the  weekends,  and  no  one  left 
the  club  with  their  dignity 
intact. 

I  mean  seriously,  where 
was  the  fun  in  all  of  this? 
Want  to  dance  to  the  same 
heavy  bass  techno  music 
week  after  week?  Sure!  Then 
maybe  I’ll  hit  on  this  sweaty, 
oversexed  football  player. 
Maybe  we’ll  have  meaningful 
discussions  about  politics  and 
philosophy  while  we  bump  ’n 


grind.  Ugh.  Yeah,  right. 

Casey  plopped  down  on 
the  stool  next  to  mine.  “You 
should  come  dance  with  us, 
B,”  she  said,  breathless  from 
her  booty  shaking.  “It’s  so 
much  fun.” 

“Sure  it  is,”  I  muttered. 

“Oh  my  gosh!”  Jessica  sat 
down  on  my  other  side,  her 
honey-blond  ponytail 
bouncing  against  her 
shoulders.  “Did  you  see  that? 


Did  you  effing  see  that? 
Harrison  Carlyle  totally  just 
hit  on  me!  Did  you  see  that? 
Omigosh!” 

Casey  rolled  her  eyes.  “He 
asked  you  where  you  got  your 
shoes,  Jess.  He’s  totally  gay.” 

“He’s  too  cute  to  be  gay.” 

Casey  ignored  her, 
running  her  fingers  behind 
her  ear,  as  if  tucking  back 
invisible  locks.  It  was  a  habit 
left  over  from  before  she’d 


chopped  her  hair  into  its 
current  edgy  blond  pixie  cut. 
“B,  you  should  dance  with  us. 
We  brought  you  here  so  that 
we  could  hang  out  with  you — 
not  that  Joe  isn’t 
entertaining.”  She  winked  at 
the  bartender,  probably 
hoping  to  score  some  free 
sodas.  “But  we’re  your 
friends.  You  should  come 
dance.  Shouldn’t  she,  Jess?” 

“Totally,”  Jessica  agreed, 


eyeing  Harrison  Carlyle,  who 
sat  in  a  booth  on  the  other 
side  of  the  room.  She  paused 
and  turned  back  to  us.  “Wait. 
What?  I  wasn’t  listening.” 

“You  just  look  so  bored 
over  here,  B.  I  want  you  to 
have  some  fun,  too.” 

“I’m  fine,”  I  lied.  “I’m 
having  a  great  time.  You 
know  I  can’t  dance.  I’d  be  in 
your  way.  Go. . .  live  it  up  or 
whatever.  I’ll  be  okay  over 


here.” 

Casey  narrowed  her  hazel 
eyes  at  me.  “You  sure?”  she 
asked. 

“Positive.” 

She  frowned,  but  after  a 
second  she  shrugged  and 
grabbed  Jessica  by  the  wrist, 
pulling  her  out  onto  the  dance 
floor.  “Holy  crap!”  Jessica 
cried.  “Slow  down,  Case! 
You’ll  rip  my  arm  off!”  Then 
they  made  their  merry  way  to 


the  middle  of  the  room, 
already  syncing  the  sway  of 
their  hips  with  the  pulsing 
techno  music. 

“Why  didn’t  you  tell  them 
you’re  miserable?”  Joe  asked, 
pushing  a  glass  of  Cherry 
Coke  toward  me. 

“I’m  not  miserable.” 

“You’re  not  a  good  liar 
either,”  he  replied  before  a 
group  of  freshmen  started 
yelling  for  drinks  at  the  other 


end  of  the  bar. 

I  sipped  my  Cherry  Coke, 
watching  the  clock  above  the 
bar.  The  second  hand  seemed 
to  be  frozen,  and  I  prayed  the 
damn  thing  was  broken  or 
something.  I  wouldn’t  ask 
Casey  and  Jessica  to  leave 
until  eleven.  Any  earlier  and 
I’d  be  the  party  pooper.  But 
according  to  the  clock  it 
wasn’t  even  nine  yet,  and  I 
could  already  feel  myself 


getting  a  techno-music 
migraine,  only  made  worse 
by  the  pulsing  strobe  light. 
Move,  second  hand !  Move ! 

“Hello  there.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes  and 
turned  to  glare  at  the 
unwelcome  intruder.  This 
happened  once  in  a  while. 
Some  guy,  usually  stoned  or 
rank  with  BO,  would  take  a 
seat  beside  me  and  make  a 
half-assed  attempt  at  small 


talk.  Clearly  they  hadn’t 
inherited  the  observant  gene, 
because  the  expression  on  my 
face  made  it  pretty  damn 
obvious  that  I  wasn’t  in  the 
mood  to  be  swept  off  my  feet. 

Surprisingly,  the  guy 
who’d  taken  the  seat  next  to 
me  didn’t  stink  like  pot  or 
armpits.  In  fact,  that  might 
have  been  cologne  I  smelled 
on  the  air.  But  my  disgust 
only  increased  when  I 


realized  who  the  cologne 
belonged  to.  I  would  have 
preferred  the  fuzzy-headed 
stoner. 

Wesley.  Fucking.  Rush. 

“What  do  you  want?”  I 
demanded,  not  even 
bothering  to  be  polite. 

“Aren’t  you  the  friendly 
type?”  Wesley  asked 
sarcastically.  “Actually,  I 
came  to  talk  to  you.” 

“Well,  that  sucks  for  you. 


I’m  not  talking  to  people 
tonight.”  I  slurped  my  drink 
loudly,  hoping  he’d  take  the 
not-so-subtle  hint  to  leave. 
No  such  luck.  I  could  feel  his 
dark  gray  eyes  crawling  all 
over  me.  He  couldn’t  even 
pretend  to  be  looking  me  in 
the  eyes,  could  he?  Ugh! 

“Come  on,”  Wesley 
teased.  “There’s  no  need  to 
be  so  cold.” 

“ Leave  me  alone,  ”  I 


hissed  through  clenched 
teeth.  “Go  try  your  charming 
act  on  some  tramp  with  low 
self-esteem,  because  I’m  not 
falling  for  it.” 

“Oh,  I’m  not  interested  in 
tramps,”  he  said.  “That’s  not 
my  thing.” 

I  snorted.  “Any  girl  who’d 
give  you  the  time  of  day, 
Wesley,  is  most  definitely  a 
tramp.  No  one  with  taste  or 
class  or  dignity  would 


actually  find  you  attractive.” 

Okay.  That  was  a  tiny  lie. 

Wesley  Rush  was  the 
most  disgusting  womanizing 
playboy  to  ever  darken  the 
doorstep  of  Hamilton  High. . . 
but  he  was  kind  of  hot. 
Maybe  if  you  could  put  him 
on  mute. . .  and  cut  off  his 
hands . . .  maybe — just  maybe 
— he’d  be  tolerable  then. 
Otherwise,  he  was  a  real 
piece  of  shit.  Horn  dog  shit. 


“And  you  do  have  taste 
and  class  and  dignity,  I 
assume?”  he  asked,  grinning. 

“Yes,  I  do.” 

“That’s  a  shame.” 

“Is  this  your  attempt  at 
flirting?”  I  asked.  “If  it  is, 
you  fail.  Epically.” 

He  laughed.  “I  never  fail 
at  flirting.”  He  ran  his  fingers 
through  his  dark,  curly  hair 
and  adjusted  his  crooked, 
arrogant  little  grin.  “I’m  just 


being  friendly.  Trying  to  have 
a  nice  conversation.” 

“Sorry.  Not  interested.”  I 
turned  away  and  took  another 
drink  of  my  Cherry  Coke.  But 
he  didn’t  move.  Not  even  an 
inch.  “You  can  go  now,”  I 
said  forcefully. 

Wesley  sighed.  “Fine. 
You’re  being  really 
uncooperative,  you  know.  So 
I  guess  I’ll  be  honest  with 
you.  I’ve  got  to  hand  it  to 


you:  you’re  smarter  and  more 
stubborn  than  most  girls  I  talk 
to.  But  I’m  here  for  a  little 
more  than  witty 
conversation.”  He  moved  his 
attention  to  the  dance  floor.  “I 
actually  need  your  help.  You 
see,  your  friends  are  hot.  And 
you,  darling,  are  the  Duff.” 

“Is  that  even  a  word?” 

“Designated.  Ugly.  Fat. 
Friend,”  he  clarified.  “No 
offense,  but  that  would  be 


you.” 

“I  am  not  the — !” 

“Hey,  don’t  get  defensive. 
It’s  not  like  you’re  an  ogre  or 
anything,  but  in 
comparison. . .”  He  shrugged 
his  broad  shoulders.  “Think 
about  it.  Why  do  they  bring 
you  here  if  you  don’t  dance?” 
He  had  the  nerve  to  reach 
over  and  pat  my  knee,  like  he 
was  trying  to  comfort  me.  I 
jerked  away  from  him,  and 


his  fingers  moved  smoothly 
to  brush  some  curls  out  of  his 
face  instead.  “Look,”  he  said, 
“you  have  hot  friends. . . 
really  hot  friends.”  He 
paused,  watching  the  action 
on  the  dance  floor  for  a 
moment,  before  facing  me 
again.  “The  point  is,  scientists 
have  proven  that  every  group 
of  friends  has  a  weak  link,  a 
Duff.  And  girls  respond  well 
to  guys  who  associate  with 


their  Duffs.” 

“Crackheads  can  call 
themselves  scientists  now? 
That’s  news  to  me.” 

“Don’t  be  bitter,”  he  said. 
“What  I’m  saying  is,  girls — 
like  your  friends — find  it 
sexy  when  guys  show  some 
sensitivity  and  socialize  with 
the  Duff.  So  by  talking  to  you 
right  now  I  am  doubling  my 
chances  of  getting  laid 
tonight.  Please  assist  me  here, 


and  just  pretend  to  enjoy  the 
conversation.” 

I  stared  at  him, 
flabbergasted,  for  a  long 
moment.  Beauty  really  was 
skin-deep.  Wesley  Rush  may 
have  had  the  body  of  a  Greek 
god,  but  his  soul  was  as  black 
and  empty  as  the  inside  of  my 
closet.  What  a  bastard! 

With  one  swift  motion  I 
jumped  to  my  feet  and  flung 
the  contents  of  my  glass  in 


Wesley’s  direction.  Cherry 
Coke  flew  all  over  him, 
splattering  his  expensive- 
looking  white  polo.  Drops  of 
dark  red  liquid  glistened  on 
his  cheeks  and  colored  his 
brown  hair.  His  face  glowed 
with  anger,  and  his  chiseled 
jaw  clinched  fiercely. 

“What  was  that  for?”  he 
snapped,  wiping  his  face  with 
the  back  of  his  hand. 

“What  do  you  think  it  was 


for?”  I  bellowed,  fists  balled 
at  my  sides. 

“Honestly,  Duffy,  I  have 
no  earthly  idea.” 

Angry  flames  blazed  in 
my  cheeks.  “If  you  think  I’m 
letting  one  of  my  friends 
leave  this  place  with  you, 
Wesley,  you’re  very,  very 
wrong,”  I  spat.  “You’re  a 
disgusting,  shallow, 
womanizing  jackass,  and  I 
hope  that  soda  stains  your 


preppy  little  shirt.”  Just 
before  I  marched  away,  I 
looked  over  my  shoulder  and 
added,  “And  my  name  isn’t 
Duffy.  It’s  Bianca.  We’ve 
been  in  the  same  homeroom 
since  middle  school,  you  self- 
absorbed  son  of  a  bitch.” 

I  never  thought  I’d  say 
this,  but  thank  God  the  damn 
techno  played  so  loud.  No 
one  but  Joe  overheard  the 
little  episode,  and  he  probably 


found  the  whole  thing 
hysterical.  I  had  to  push  my 
way  through  the  crowded 
dance  floor  to  find  my 
friends.  When  I  tracked  them 
down,  I  grabbed  Casey  and 
Jessica  by  their  elbows  and 
tugged  them  toward  the  exit. 

“Hey!”  Jessica  protested. 

“What’s  wrong?”  Casey 
asked. 

“We’re  getting  the  fuck 
out  of  here,”  I  said,  yanking 


their  unwilling  bodies  along 
behind  me.  “I’ll  explain  in  the 
car.  I  just  can’t  stand  to  be  in 
this  hellhole  for  one  more 
second.” 

“Can’t  I  say  bye  to 
Harrison  first?”  Jessica 
whined,  trying  to  loosen  my 
grip  on  her  arm. 

“Jessica!”  I  cricked  my 
neck  painfully  when  I  twisted 
around  to  face  her.  “He’s 
gay!  You  don’t  have  a 


chance,  so  just  give  it  up 
already.  I  need  to  get  out  of 
here.  Please.” 

I  pulled  them  out  into  the 
parking  lot,  where  the  icy 
January  air  tore  at  the  bare 
flesh  of  our  faces.  Relenting, 
Casey  and  Jessica  gathered 
close  on  either  side  of  me. 
They  must  have  found  their 
outfits,  which  were  intended 
to  be  sexy,  ill  equipped  to 
handle  the  windchill.  We 


moved  to  my  car  in  a  huddle, 
separating  only  when  we 
reached  the  front  bumper.  I 
clicked  the  unlock  button  on 
my  key  chain  so  that  we 
could  climb  into  the  slightly 
warmer  cab  of  the  Saturn 
without  delay. 

Casey  curled  up  in  the 
front  seat  and  said,  through 
chattering  teeth,  “Why  are  we 
leaving  so  early?  B,  it’s  only, 
like,  nine-fifteen.” 


Jessica  sulked  in  the 
backseat  with  an  ancient 
blanket  wrapped  around  her 
like  a  cocoon.  (My  piece-of- 
shit  heater  rarely  decided  to 
work,  so  I  kept  a  stash  of 
blankets  on  the  floorboard.) 

“I  got  into  an  argument 
with  someone,”  I  explained, 
jabbing  the  key  into  the 
ignition  with  unnecessary 
force.  “I  threw  my  Coke  on 
him,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  stick 


around  for  his  response.” 

“Who?”  Casey  asked. 

I’d  been  dreading  that 
question  because  I  knew  the 
reaction  I’d  get.  “Wesley 
Rush.” 

Two  swoony,  girly  sighs 
followed  my  answer. 

“Oh,  come  on,”  I  fumed. 
“The  guy  is  a  man- whore.  I 
can’t  stand  him.  He  sleeps 
with  everything  that  moves, 
and  his  brain  is  located  in  his 


pants — which  means  it’s 
microscopic.” 

“I  doubt  that,”  Casey  said 
with  another  sigh.  “God,  B, 
only  you  could  find  a  flaw  in 
Wesley  Rush.” 

I  glared  at  her  as  I  turned 
my  head  to  back  out  of  the 
parking  lot.  “He’s  a  jerk.” 

“That’s  not  true,”  Jessica 
interjected.  “Jeanine  said  he 
talked  to  her  at  a  party 
recently.  She  was  with  Vikki 


and  Angela,  and  she  said  he 
just  came  up  and  sat  down 
beside  her.  He  was  really 
friendly.” 

That  made  sense.  Jeanine 
was  definitely  the  Duff  if  she 
was  out  with  Angela  and 
Vikki.  I  wondered  which  of 
them  left  with  Wesley  that 
night. 

“He’s  charming,”  Casey 
said.  “You’re  just  being  Little 
Miss  Cynical,  as  usual.”  She 


gave  me  a  warm  smile  from 
across  the  cab.  “But  what  the 
hell  did  he  do  to  get  you  to 
throw  Coke  at  him?”  Now  she 
sounded  concerned.  Took  her 
long  enough.  “Did  he  say 
something  to  you,  B?” 

“No,”  I  lied.  “It’s  nothing. 
He  just  pisses  me  off.” 

Duff. 

The  word  bounced  around 
in  my  mind  as  I  sped  down 
5th  Street.  I  couldn’t  bring 


myself  to  tell  my  friends 
about  the  wonderful  new 
insult  that  had  just  been 
added  to  my  vocab  list,  but 
when  I  glanced  at  myself  in 
the  rearview  mirror,  Wesley’ 
assertion  that  I  was  the 
unattractive,  undesirable 
tagalong  (more  like 
dragalong)  seemed  to  be 
confirmed.  Jessica’s  perfect 
hourglass  figure  and  warm, 
welcoming  brown  eyes. 


Casey’s  flawless  complexion 
and  mile-long  legs.  I  couldn’t 
compare  to  either  of  them. 

“Well,  I  say  we  hit 
another  party,  since  it’s  so 
early,”  Casey  suggested.  “I 
heard  about  this  one  out  in 
Oak  Hill.  Some  college  kid  is 
home  for  Christmas  break 
and  decided  to  have  a  big 
blowout.  Angela  told  me 
about  it  this  morning.  Want  to 
go?” 


“Yeah!”  Jessica 
straightened  up  beneath  the 
blanket.  “We  should  totally 
go!  College  parties  have 
college  boys.  Won’t  that  be 
fun,  Bianca?” 

I  sighed.  “No.  Not  really.” 

“Oh,  come  on.”  Casey 
reached  over  and  squeezed 
my  arm.  “No  dancing  this 
time,  okay?  And  Jess  and  I 
promise  to  keep  all  hot  guys 
away  from  you,  since  clearly 


you  hate  them.”  She  smirked, 
trying  to  nudge  me  back  into 
a  good  mood. 

“I  don’t  hate  hot  guys,”  I 
told  her.  “Just  the  one.”  After 
a  moment,  I  sighed  and 
turned  onto  the  highway, 
heading  for  the  county  line. 
“Fine,  we’ll  go.  But  you  two 
are  buying  me  ice  cream 
afterward.  Two  scoops.” 

“Deal.”

There  is  nothing  more 
peaceful  than  quiet  on  a 
Saturday  night — or  very  early 
Sunday  morning.  Dad’s 
muffled  snores  rumbled  from 
down  the  hall,  but  the  rest  of 
the  house  was  silent  when  I 
crept  in  sometime  after  one. 


Or  maybe  I’d  been  deafened 
by  the  thudding  bass  at  the 
Oak  Hill  party.  Honestly,  the 
idea  of  hearing  loss  didn’t 
bother  me  too  much.  If  it 
meant  I  never  had  to  listen  to 
techno  again,  I  was  all  for  it. 

I  locked  the  front  door 
behind  me  and  walked 
through  the  dark,  empty 
living  room.  I  saw  the 
postcard  lying  on  the  coffee 
table,  sent  from  whatever  city 


Mom  was  in  now,  but  I  didn’t 
bother  reading  it.  It  would 
still  be  there  in  the  morning, 
and  I  was  just  too  tired,  so  I 
dragged  myself  up  the  stairs 
to  my  bedroom  instead. 

Stifling  a  yawn,  I  hung  my 
coat  over  the  back  of  my  desk 
chair  and  moved  over  to  my 
bed.  The  migraine  began  to 
subside  as  I  kicked  my 
Converse  across  the  room.  I 
was  exhausted,  but  my  OCD 


was  totally  calling.  The  pile 
of  clean  laundry  on  the  floor, 
by  the  foot  of  my  bed  had  to 
be  folded  before  I’d  ever  be 
able  to  sleep. 

Carefully,  I  lifted  each 
piece  of  clothing  and  folded  it 
with  embarrassing  precision. 
Then  I  stacked  the  shirts, 
jeans,  and  underwear  in 
separate  sections  on  the  floor. 
Somehow,  the  act  of  folding 
the  wrinkled  clothes  soothed 


me.  As  I  made  the  perfect 
piles,  my  mind  cleared,  my 
body  relaxed,  and  my 
irritation  from  the  night  of 
loud  music  and  obnoxious, 
rich,  sex-obsessed  pigs  ebbed. 
With  every  even  crease,  I  was 
reborn. 

When  all  of  the  clothes 
were  folded,  I  stood  up, 
leaving  the  stacks  on  the 
floor.  I  pulled  off  my  sweater 
and  jeans,  which  stank  from 


the  sweltering  parties,  and 
tossed  them  into  the  hamper 
in  the  corner  of  my  room.  I 
could  shower  in  the  morning. 

I  was  too  tired  to  deal  with  it 
tonight. 

Before  crawling  under  my 
sheets,  I  took  a  glance  at  the 
full-length  mirror  across  the 
room.  I  searched  my 
reflection  with  new  eyes,  with 
new  knowledge. 
Uncontrollable  wavy  auburn 


hair.  A  long  nose.  Big  thighs. 
Small  boobs.  Yep.  Definitely 
Duff  material.  How  had  I  not 
known? 

I  mean,  I’d  never 
considered  myself 
particularly  attractive  and  it 
wasn’t  hard  to  see  that  Casey 
and  Jessica,  both  thin  and 
blond,  were  gorgeous,  but 
still.  The  fact  that  I  played  the 
role  of  the  ugly  girl  to  their 
luscious  duo  hadn’t  occurred 


to  me.  Thanks  to  Wesley 
Rush,  I  could  see  it  now. 

Sometimes  it’s  better  to  be 
clueless. 

I  pulled  a  blanket  up  to 
my  chin,  hiding  my  naked 
body  from  the  scrutiny  of  the 
mirror.  Wesley  was  living 
proof  that  beauty  was  only 
skin-deep,  so  why  did  his 
words  bother  me?  I  was 
intelligent.  I  was  a  good 
person.  So  who  cared  if  I  was 


the  Duff?  If  I  were  attractive, 
I’d  have  to  deal  with  guys 
like  Wesley  hitting  on  me. 
Ugh!  So  being  the  Duff  had 
its  benefits,  right?  Being 
unattractive  didn’t  have  to 
suck. 

Damn  Wesley  Rush!  I 
couldn’t  believe  he  was 
making  me  worry  about  such 
stupid,  pointless,  shallow 
bullshit. 

I  closed  my  eyes.  I 


wouldn’t  think  about  it  in  the 
morning.  I  wouldn’t  think 
about  Duffs  ever  again. 

Sunday  was  fantastic — nice, 
quiet,  uninterrupted  euphoria. 
Of  course,  things  were 
usually  pretty  quiet  when 
Mom  was  away.  When  she 
was  home,  the  house  always 
seemed  loud.  There  was 
always  music  or  laughter  or 
something  lively  and  chaotic. 


But  she  never  seemed  to  be 
home  for  more  than  a  couple 
of  months,  and  in  the  time 
that  she  was  gone,  everything 
grew  still.  Like  me,  Dad 
wasn’t  much  for  socializing. 
He  was  usually  buried  in  his 
work  or  watching  television. 
Which  meant  the  Piper  house 
was  pretty  much  silent. 

And,  on  a  morning  after 
I’d  been  forced  to  withstand 
all  the  racket  of  clubs  and 


parties,  a  quiet  house  was  the 
equivalent  of  perfection. 

But  Monday  sucked. 

All  Mondays  suck,  of 
course,  but  this  Monday 
really  fucked  up  everything. 

It  all  started  first  block  when 
Jessica  slumped  into  Spanish 
with  tear-stained  cheeks  and 
running  mascara. 

“Jessica,  what’s  wrong?”  I 
asked.  “Did  something 
happen?  Is  everything  okay?” 


I’ll  admit  it;  I  always  got 
really  freaked  out  on  the  rare 
occasions  when  Jessica  came 
to  class  looking  anything  less 
than  perky.  I  mean,  she  was 
constantly  bouncing  and 
giggling.  So  when  she  came 
in  looking  so  depressed,  it 
scared  the  shit  out  of  me. 

Jessica  shook  her  head 
miserably  and  collapsed  into 
her  seat.  “Everything’s  fine, 
but. . .  I  can’t  go  to 


Homecoming!”  Fresh  tears 
spewed  from  her  wide 
chocolate  eyes.  “Mom  won’t 
let  me  go!” 

That  was  it?  She’d  gotten 
me  all  freaked  out  over 
Homecoming? 

“Why  not?”  I  asked,  still 
trying  to  be  sympathetic. 

“I’m  grounded,”  Jessica 
sniffed.  “She  saw  my  report 
card  in  my  room  this 
morning,  and  she  found  out 


I’m  failing  chemistry,  and  she 
flipped  out!  It’s  not  effing 
fair!  Basketball  Homecoming 
is,  like,  my  favorite  dance  of 
the  year. . .  after  prom  and 
Sadie  Hawkins  and  Football 
Homecoming.” 

I  tilted  my  chin  down  and 
looked  at  her  teasingly. 
“Wow,  how  many  favorites 
do  you  have?” 

She  didn’t  answer.  Or 
laugh. 


“I’m  sorry,  Jessica.  I 
know  it  must  suck. . .  but  I’m 
not  going  either.”  I  didn’t 
mention  that  I  considered  the 
whole  practice  of  school 
dances  degrading  or  that  they 
were  just  giant  wastes  of  time 
and  money.  Jessica  already 
knew  my  opinions  on  the 
matter,  and  I  didn’t  think 
reminding  her  would  help  the 
situation.  But  I  was  pretty 
happy  I  wouldn’t  be  the  only 


girl  skipping.  “How  about 
this:  I’ll  come  over,  and  we’ll 
watch  movies  all  night.  Will 
your  mom  be  cool  with  that?” 

Jessica  nodded  and  wiped 
her  eyes  with  the  cuff  of  her 
sleeve.  “Yeah,”  she  said. 
“Mom  likes  you.  She  thinks 
you’re  a  good  influence  on 
me.  So  that’ll  be  okay. 
Thanks,  Bianca.  Can  we 
watch  Atonement  again?  Are 
you  sick  of  it  yet?” 


Yes,  I  was  getting  very 
sick  of  the  mushy  romances 
Jessica  swooned  over,  but  I 
could  get  over  it.  I  grinned  at 
her.  “I  never  get  tired  of 
James  McAvoy.  We  can  even 
watch  Becoming  Jane  if  you 
want.  It’ll  be  a  double 
feature.” 

She  laughed — finally — 
just  as  the  teacher  made  her 
way  to  the  front  of  the  room 
and  began  obsessively 


straightening  the  pencils  on 
her  desk  before  calling  roll. 
Jessica  tossed  a  glance  at  the 
scrawny  instructor.  When  she 
looked  back  at  me,  her  dark 
brown  eyes  sparkled  with  a 
few  fresh  tears.  “You  know 
what  the  worst  part  is, 
Bianca?”  she  whispered.  “I 
was  gonna  ask  Harrison  to  go 
with  me.  Now  I’ll  have  to 
wait  until  prom  to  ask  him  to 
a  dance.” 


Because  of  her  sensitive 
state,  I  decided  not  to  remind 
her  that  Harrison  wouldn’t  be 
interested  because  she  had 
boobs — big  ones.  Instead  I 
just  said,  “I  know.  I’m  sorry, 
Jessica.” 

Once  that  little  crisis  was 
behind  us,  Spanish  went  by 
smoothly.  Jessica’s  tears 
cleared  up,  and  by  the  time 
the  bell  rang,  she  was 
laughing  giddily  while 


Angela,  a  friend  of  ours,  told 
us  about  her  new  boyfriend.  I 
found  out  that  I’d  made  an  A 
on  my  last  prueba  de 
vocabulario.  Plus,  I  totally 
understood  how  to  conjugate 
regular  present  subjunctive 
verbs.  So  I  was  in  a  pretty 
damn  good  mood  when 
Jessica,  Angela,  and  I  walked 
out  of  the  classroom. 

“And  he  has  a  job  on 
campus,”  Angela  rambled  as 


we  pushed  our  way  into  the 
crowded  hall. 

“Where  does  he  go  to 
school?”  I  asked. 

“Oak  Hill  Community 
College.”  She  sounded  a  little 
embarrassed,  and  she  quickly 
added,  “But  he’s  just  getting 
his  associate’s  degree  there 
before  he  goes  to  a  university. 
And  OHCC  isn’t  a  bad  school 
or  anything.” 

“That’s  where  I’m  going,” 


Jessica  said.  “I  don’t  want  to 
go  too  far  from  home.” 

Jessica  and  I  were  such 
polar  opposites,  it  was  sort  of 
funny  sometimes.  You  could 
always  predict  what  one  of  us 
was  going  to  want  to  do  just 
by  picking  the  reverse  of  the 
other.  Personally,  I  wanted  to 
get  the  hell  out  of  Hamilton 
as  soon  as  possible. 
Graduation  couldn’t  arrive 
soon  enough,  and  then  I’d  be 


off  to  New  York  for  college. 

But  the  idea  of  being  so 
far  away  from  Jessica — not 
seeing  her  bounce  by  me 
every  day  or  hearing  her 
jabber  about  dances  and  gay 
boys — suddenly  scared  me.  I 
wasn’t  entirely  sure  how  I’d 
handle  it.  She  and  Casey  kind 
of  balanced  me  out.  I  wasn’t 
sure  anyone  else  would  be 
willing  to  put  up  with  my 
cynicism  once  I  left  town. 


“We  should  get  to 
chemistry,  Jess,”  Angela  said 
as  she  shook  her  long  black 
bangs  from  her  eyes.  “You 
know  how  Mr.  Rollins  gets 
when  we  show  up  late.” 

They  scampered  off  to  the 
science  department,  and  I 
started  down  the  hallway 
heading  toward  AP 
government.  My  mind  drifted 
to  other  places,  to  a  future 
without  my  best  friends  to 


keep  me  sane.  I’d  never 
considered  that  before,  and 
now  that  I  was  thinking  about 
it,  it  made  me  really  nervous. 

I  knew  they’d  tease  me  for  it, 
but  I  would  have  to  find  a 
way  to  keep  in  constant 
touch. 

I  guess  my  eyes  lost 
contact  with  my  brain, 
because  the  next  thing  I 
knew,  I  ran  smack  into 
Wesley  Rush. 


That  was  the  end  of  my 
good  mood. 

I  stumbled  backward,  and 
all  of  my  textbooks  slipped 
from  my  arms  and  crashed  to 
the  floor.  Wesley  grabbed  me 
by  both  shoulders,  his  large 
hands  catching  me  before  I 
had  the  chance  to  trip  over 
my  own  feet  and  slam  into 
the  tile. 

“Whoa,”  he  said, 
steadying  me. 


We  were  standing  way  too 
close  to  each  other.  I  felt  like 
I  had  bugs  crawling  under  my 
skin,  spreading  from  the 
places  where  his  hands 
touched  me.  I  shivered  with 
disgust,  but  he  misread  it. 

“Wow,  Duffy,”  he  said, 
looking  down  at  me  with  a 
cocky  grin.  He  was  really  tall 
— I’d  forgotten  that,  sitting 
next  to  him  at  the  Nest  the 
other  night.  He  was  one  of  the 


only  boys  in  our  school  who 
was  taller  than  Casey — at 
least  six  two.  An  entire  foot 
taller  than  me.  “Do  I  make 
you  weak  in  the  knees?” 

“As  if.”  I  twisted  out  of 
his  grasp,  fully  aware  that  I 
sounded  like  Alicia 
Silvers  tone  in  Clueless  but 
just  not  caring.  I  knelt  down 
and  began  to  gather  my 
books,  and  to  my  intense 
displeasure,  Wesley  joined 


me.  He  was  playing  the  Good 
Samaritan  role,  of  course.  I 
bet  he  was  hoping  some  hot 
cheerleader,  like  Casey, 
would  walk  by  and  think  he 
was  being  a  gentleman.  What 
a  pig.  Always  looking  to 
score. 

“Spanish,  huh?”  he  said, 
glancing  down  at  the 
scattered  papers  as  he 
grabbed  them.  “Can  you  say 
anything  interesting?” 


“El  tono  de  tu  voz  hace 
que  quiera  estrangularme .”  I 
stood  up  and  waited  for  him 
to  hand  over  my  papers. 

“That  sounds  sexy,”  he 
said,  getting  to  his  feet  and 
handing  me  the  stack  of 
Spanish  work  he’d  swept 
together.  “What’s  it  mean?” 

“The  sound  of  your  voice 
makes  me  want  to  strangle 
myself.” 

“Kinky.” 


Without  another  word,  I 
jerked  the  papers  from  his 
hands,  tucked  them  inside  one 
of  my  books,  and  stomped  off 
to  class.  I  needed  to  put  as 
much  distance  between 
myself  and  the  womanizing 
bastard  as  possible.  Duffy? 
Seriously?  He  knew  my 
name!  The  egotistical  jackass 
just  couldn’t  let  me  be.  Not  to 
mention  my  skin  was  still 
itching  where  he’d  touched 


me. 

Mr.  Chaucer’s  AP 
government  class  consisted  of 
only  nine  students,  and  seven 
of  them  were  already  in  the 
room  by  the  time  I  walked 
through  the  door.  Mr. 

Chaucer  gave  me  a  dirty  look 
through  his  squinting  eyes, 
impressing  upon  me  that  the 
bell  would  ring  any  second. 

To  be  late  was  a  felony  in  Mr. 
Chaucer’s  opinion,  and  to  be 


almost  late  constituted  a 
misdemeanor.  I  wasn’t  the 
last  one  to  show  up,  though. 
That  helped  a  little. 

I  took  my  seat  in  the  very 
back  of  the  room  and  started 
to  open  my  notebook,  hoping 
to  God  that  Mr.  Chaucer 
wouldn’t  call  me  out  on  my 
near  tardiness.  With  my 
current  mood,  there  was  no 
guarantee  I  wouldn’t  start 
cussing  at  him.  He  didn’t,  and 


we  were  both  saved  the 
drama. 

The  last  student  entered 
just  as  the  bell  rang.  “Sorry, 
Mr.  Chaucer.  I  was  putting  up 
signs  promoting  next  week’s 
inauguration  ceremony.  You 
didn’t  start  already,  did  you?” 

My  heart  skipped  a  beat 
when  I  looked  up  at  the  boy 
who ’d  just  come  in. 

Okay,  so  I’m  not  quiet 
about  the  fact  that  I  hate 


teenagers  who  date  in  high 
school  and  constantly  rant 
and  rave  about  how  much 
they  “love”  their  boyfriend  or 
girlfriend.  I  freely  admit  that  I 
hate  girls  who  say  they  love 
someone  before  they’ve  dated 
them.  I  don’t  hide  the  fact 
that,  in  my  opinion,  love 
takes  years — five  or  ten  at 
least — to  develop,  and  high 
school  relationships  seem 
incredibly  pointless  to  me. 


Everyone  knew  this  about 
me. . .  but  nobody  knew  that  I 
was  almost  a  hypocrite. 

Well,  okay,  Casey  and 
Jessica  knew,  but  that  didn’t 
count. 

Toby  Tucker.  Aside  from 
the  tragic  alliteration,  he  was 
perfect  in  every  single  way. 
He  wasn’t  a  testosterone- 
loaded  football  player.  He 
wasn’t  an  overly  sensitive 
guitar-playing  hippie.  He 


didn’t  write  poetry  or  wear 
eyeliner.  So  he  probably 
wouldn’t  have  been  classified 
as  the  typical  hottie,  but  that 
worked  in  my  favor,  right? 
Jocks,  guys  in  bands,  and 
Emo  boys  didn’t  look  twice  at 
— as  Wesley  would  have  so 
delicately  worded  it — the 
Duff.  I  probably  had  a  better 
chance  with  intelligent, 
politically  active,  somewhat 
socially  awkward  guys  like 


Toby.  Right? 

Wrong,  wrong,  wrong. 

Toby  Tucker  was  my 
perfect  match.  Unfortunately, 
he  wasn’t  aware  of  this  fact. 
That  was  mostly  because  I 
lost  my  ability  to  form 
coherent  sentences  every  time 
he  got  close  to  me.  He 
probably  thought  I  was  mute 
or  something.  He  never 
looked  at  me  or  spoke  to  me 
or  even  seemed  to  notice  me 


in  the  back  of  the  room.  For  a 
girl  with  such  a  fat  ass,  I  felt 
pretty  invisible. 

I  noticed  Toby,  though.  I 
noticed  his  outdated  yet 
adorable  blond  bowl  cut  and 
his  pasty  ivory  skin.  I  noticed 
his  green  eyes  beneath  the 
lenses  of  his  oval  glasses.  I 
noticed  that  he  wore  a  blazer 
with  everything,  and  I  noticed 
the  adorable  way  he  bit  his 
lower  lip  when  he  was 


thinking  really  hard  about 
something.  I  was  in. . .  okay, 
not  love,  but  definitely  like.  I 
was  deeply  in  like  with  Toby 
Tucker. 

“Fine,”  Mr.  Chaucer 
muttered.  “Just  keep  an  eye 
on  your  watch  tomorrow,  Mr. 
Tucker.” 

“Sure  thing,  sir.” 

Toby  took  a  seat  in  the 
front  row  next  to  Jeanine 
McPhee.  Like  a  stalker,  I 


listened  in  on  their 
conversation  while  Mr. 
Chaucer  started  writing  the 
lecture  notes  on  the 
whiteboard.  I’m  not  normally 
such  a  creep,  but  lo — like 
makes  people  do  crazy  things. 
At  least  that’s  the  popular 
excuse. 

“How  was  your  weekend, 
Toby?”  Jeanine  asked 
through  her  constantly  stuffy 
nose.  “Did  you  do  anything 


exciting?” 

“It  was  pretty  good,”  Toby 
said.  “Dad  took  Nina  and  me 
out  of  state.  We  toured  the 
University  of  Southern 
Illinois  together.  That  was 
fun.” 

“Is  Nina  your  sister?” 
Jeanine  asked. 

“No.  Nina’s  my  girlfriend. 
She  goes  to  Oak  Hill  High 
School.  Didn’t  I  tell  you 
about  her?  Anyway,  we  both 


got  accepted  there,  so  we 
wanted  to  check  it  out.  I’m 
looking  at  a  few  other 
schools,  but  we’ve  been 
together  for  a  year  and  a  half, 
and  we  kind  of  want  to  attend 
the  same  school  to  avoid  the 
long-distance  issue.” 

“That’s  sweet!”  Jeanine 
cried.  “I’m  actually 
considering  just  doing  some 
classes  at  OHCC  before  I 
decide  what  university  I’ll  go 


to.” 

My  skin  had  stopped 
crawling,  but  now  my 
stomach  was  doing  sickening 
somersaults.  I  thought  I  was 
going  to  vomit,  and  I  had  to 
fight  the  urge  to  run  from  the 
room  with  a  hand  cupped 
over  my  mouth.  Eventually,  I 
won  the  battle  to  keep  my 
breakfast  where  it  belonged, 
but  I  still  felt  pretty  shitty. 

Toby  had  a  girlfriend?  For 


a  year  and  a  half?  Oh  my 
God!  How  had  I  missed  that? 
And  they  were  going  to 
college  together?  Did  that 
mean  he  was  one  of  those 
stupid,  mushy  romantics  I 
mocked  on  a  daily  basis?  I’d 
expected  so  much  more  from 
Toby  Tucker.  I’d  expected 
him  to  be  just  as  skeptical 
about  the  nature  of  teenage 
love  as  I  was.  I’d  expected 
him  to  see  college  as  a  huge 


decision,  not  one  that  should 
be  swayed  by  where  your 
boyfriend/girlfriend  got 
accepted.  I’d  expected  him  to 
be...  well,  smart ! 

He  wouldn  ’t  date  you, 
anyway,  a  voice  in  my  head 
hissed  at  me.  It  sounded 
uncannily  like  Wesley  Rush’s 
unnerving  whisper.  You  Ye 
the  Duff,  remember?  His 
girlfriend  is  probably  thinner 
with  bigger  boobs. 


It  wasn’t  even  lunch  yet, 
and  I  already  wanted  to  jump 
off  a  cliff.  Well,  okay,  that 
was  overdramatic.  I  definitely 
wanted  to  go  home  and  go  to 
bed,  though.  I  wanted  to 
forget  Toby  had  a  serious 
girlfriend.  I  wanted  to  wash 
the  feeling  of  Wesley’s  hands 
off  me.  Mostly,  though,  I 
wanted  to  erase  the  word  Duff 
from  my  memory. 

Oh,  yeah,  and  things  got 


worse  that  day,  too. 

Around  six  o’clock  that 
night,  the  guy  on  the  news 
started  talking  about  some  big 
snowstorm  that  would  show 
up  in  the  “early  morning 
hours.”  I  guess  the  school 
board  took  pity  on  us  since 
we  hadn’t  had  a  single  snow 
day  so  far,  because  they  went 
ahead  and  canceled  classes 
before  the  storm  even  hit.  So 
Casey  called  at  seven-thirty 


and  insisted  that  we  go  to  the 
Nest,  since  we  didn’t  have  to 
get  up  early  the  next  morning. 

“I  don’t  know,  Casey,”  I 
said.  “What  if  the  roads  are 
bad?”  I’ll  admit  it.  I  was 
looking  for  any  reason  not  to 
go.  My  day  had  been  crappy 
enough  on  its  own.  I  didn’t 
know  if  I  could  endure  the 
torture  of  that  hellhole,  too. 

“B,  the  storm  isn’t 
supposed  to  even  start  until, 


like,  three  a.m.  or  something. 
As  long  as  we’re  home  by 
then  it’ll  be  cool.” 

“I  have  a  lot  of 
homework.” 

“It’s  not  due  until 
Wednesday.  You  can  work  on 
it  all  day  tomorrow  if  you 
want.” 

I  sighed.  “Can  you  and 
Jessica  find  another  ride  and 
go  without  me?  I  just  don’t 
feel  up  to  it.  It’s  been  a  bad 


day,  Casey.” 

I  could  always  rely  on 
Casey  to  act  at  the  slightest 
sign  of  trouble.  “What 
happened?”  she  asked.  “Are 
you  okay?  You  didn’t  look 
happy  at  lunch.  Is  it  about 
your  mom?” 

“Casey.” 

“Tell  me  what’s  up.” 

“Nothing,”  I  assured  her. 
“Today  just  sucked,  okay? 
Nothing  major  or  anything. 


I’m  just  not  in  the  mood  to  go 
partying  with  you  guys 
tonight.” 

There  was  a  pause  on  the 
other  end  of  the  line.  Finally, 
Casey  said,  “Bianca,  you 
know  you  can  tell  me 
anything,  right?  You  know 
you  can  talk  to  me  if  you 
need  to.  Don’t  keep  things 
bottled  up.  It’s  not  good  for 
you.” 

“Casey,  I’m  fi — 


“You’re  fine,”  she 
interrupted.  “Yeah,  I  know. 
I’m  just  saying  that  if  you 
have  a  problem,  I’m  here  for 
you.” 

“I  know,”  I  murmured.  I 
felt  guilty  for  getting  her 
nervous  like  that  over 
something  so  stupid.  I  had  a 
bad  habit  of  holding  in  all  my 
emotions,  and  Casey  knew 
that  all  too  well.  She  was 
always  trying  to  look  out  for 


me.  Always  coaxing  me  into 
sharing  so  that  I  didn’t  wind 
up  exploding  later.  It  could 
get  annoying,  but  knowing 
that  someone  cared. . .  well, 
that  felt  nice.  So  I  couldn’t 
really  get  mad  about  it.  “I 
know,  Casey.  I’m  fine, 
though.  It’s  just. . .  I  found  out 
Toby  has  a  girlfriend  today, 
and  I’m  a  little  bummed. 
That’s  all.” 

“Oh,  B,”  she  sighed.  “That 


sucks.  I’m  sorry.  Maybe  if 
you  come  out  tonight,  Jess 
and  I  can  cheer  you  up.  Two 
scoops  of  ice  cream  and 
everything.” 

I  let  out  a  little  laugh. 
“Thanks,  but  no  thanks.  I 
think  I’ll  just  stay  home 
tonight.” 

I  hung  up  the  phone  and 
went  downstairs,  where  I 
found  Dad  using  the  cordless 
in  the  kitchen.  I  heard  him 


before  I  saw  him.  He  was 
yelling  into  the  receiver.  I 
stood  in  the  doorway, 
assuming  he’d  notice  me  and 
immediately  lower  his  voice. 
I  figured  some  telemarketer 
was  getting  an  earful  of  Mike 
Piper,  but  then  my  name 
came  up. 

“Think  of  what  you’re 
doing  to  Bianca!”  Dad’s  loud 
voice,  which  I’d  taken  for 
anger,  sounded  more  like 


pleading.  “This  isn’t  good  for 
a  seventeen-year-old  girl  and 
her  mother.  She  needs  you 
here  at  home,  Gina.  We  need 
you  here.” 

I  slipped  back  into  the 
living  room,  surprised  to 
realize  he  was  talking  to  my 
mother.  Truthfully,  I  didn’t 
really  know  how  to  feel  about 
it.  About  the  things  he  was 
saying.  I  mean,  yeah,  I 
missed  my  mom.  Having  her 


home  would  have  been  nice, 
but  it  wasn’t  as  if  we  weren’t 
used  to  getting  along  without 
her. 

My  mother  was  a 
motivational  speaker.  When  I 
was  a  kid,  she’d  written  some 
sort  of  uplifting,  inspirational 
book  about  improving  self¬ 
esteem.  It  hadn’t  sold  well, 
but  she  still  got  offers  to 
speak  at  colleges,  support 
groups,  and  graduations  all 


over  the  country.  Since  the 
book  had  flopped,  she  came 
pretty  cheap. 

For  a  while,  she’d  taken 
only  local  jobs.  Ones  she 
could  drive  home  from  after 
she  finished  telling  people 
how  to  love  themselves.  But 
after  my  grandmother  passed 
away,  when  I  was  twelve, 
Mom  got  a  little  depressed. 
Dad  suggested  she  take  a 
vacation.  Just  get  away  for  a 


few  weeks. 

When  she  came  back,  she 
gushed  about  all  the  places 
she’d  seen  and  the  people 
she’d  met.  I  guess  maybe 
that’s  what  sparked  her 
addiction  to  traveling. 
Because  after  that  first 
vacation,  Mom  started 
booking  events  all  over  the 
place.  In  Colorado  and  New 
Hampshire.  She’d  set  up 
entire  tours. 


Only  this  tour,  the  one  she 
was  on  now,  had  been  the 
longest.  She  hadn’t  been 
home  in  almost  two  months, 
and  this  time  I  wasn’t  even 
sure  where  she  was  speaking. 

Obviously  that  was  why 
Dad  was  pissed.  Because 
she’d  been  gone  for  so  long. 

“Damn  it,  Gina.  When  are 
you  going  to  stop  being  a 
child  and  come  home?  When 
are  you  coming  home  to  us . . . 


for  good?”  The  way  my  dad’s 
voice  cracked  when  he 
uttered  that  sentence  nearly 
had  me  in  tears.  “Gina,”  he 
murmured.  “Gina,  we  love 
you.  Bianca  and  I  miss  you, 
and  we  want  you  to  come 
home.” 

I  pressed  myself  against 
the  wall  that  separated  me 
from  Dad,  biting  my  lip.  God, 
it  was  just  getting  pathetic.  I 
mean,  why  wouldn’t  they  just 


get  a  fucking  divorce 
already?  Was  I  the  only  one 
who  could  see  that  things  just 
weren’t  working  out  here? 
What  was  the  point  of  being 
married  if  Mom  was  always 
gone? 

“Gina,”  my  father  said, 
and  I  thought  it  sounded  like 
he  was  on  the  verge  of  crying. 
Then  I  heard  him  put  the 
phone  down  on  the  counter. 
The  talk  was  over. 


I  gave  him  a  couple  of 
minutes  before  I  walked  into 
the  kitchen.  “Hey,  Dad.  Is 
everything  okay?” 

“Yeah,”  he  said.  God,  he 
was  a  bad  liar.  “Oh,  it’s  fine, 
Bumblebee.  I  just  had  a  talk 
with  your  mom  and. . .  she 
sends  her  love.” 

“From  where  this  time?” 

“Um...  Orange  County,” 
he  said.  “She’s  visiting  your 
aunt  Leah  while  she  speaks  at 


a  high  school  there.  Cool, 
huh?  You  can  tell  your 
friends  that  your  mom  is  in 
the  O.C.  now.  You  like  that 
show,  don’t  you?” 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “I  liked 
it. . .  but  it  got  canceled  a  few 
years  ago.” 

“Oh,  well. . .  I  guess  I’m 
behind,  Bumblebee.”  I  saw 
his  eyes  drift  over  to  the 
counter,  where  he’d  left  his 
car  keys,  and  I  followed 


them.  He  noticed  this  and 
looked  away  quickly,  before  I 
could  say  anything.  “Do  you 
have  plans  tonight?”  he 
asked. 

“Well,  I  could  make  some, 
but. . .”  I  cleared  my  throat, 
uncertain  of  how  to  say  my 
next  sentence.  Dad  and  I 
really  didn’t  make  a  habit  of 
talking  to  each  other.  “I  could 
stay  home,  too.  Do  you  want 
me  to  stay  here  and,  like, 


watch  TV  with  you  or 
something?” 

“Oh,  no,  Bumblebee,”  he 
said  with  an  unconvincing 
laugh.  “Go  have  fun  with 
your  friends.  I’ll  probably  go 
to  bed  early  tonight, 
anyway.” 

I  looked  him  in  the  eye, 
hoping  he’d  change  his  mind. 
Dad  always  got  really 
depressed  after  his  fights  with 
Mom.  I  was  worried  about 


him,  but  I  wasn’t  really  sure 
how  to  approach  the  subject. 

And  in  the  back  of  my 
mind,  there  was  this  tiny  fear. 
It  was  stupid,  really,  but  I 
couldn’t  shake  it.  My  father 
was  a  recovering  alcoholic.  I 
mean,  he  quit  before  I  was 
bom,  and  he  hadn’t  touched  a 
drop  since...  but  sometimes, 
when  he  got  all  pouty  about 
Mom,  I  got  scared.  Scared 
that  he  might  take  those  car 


keys  and  head  to  the  liquor 
store  or  something.  Like  I 
said,  it  was  ridiculous,  but  the 
fear  couldn’t  be  vanquished. 

Dad  broke  our  eye  contact 
and  shifted  uncomfortably. 

He  turned  and  walked  toward 
the  sink,  washing  the  plate 
he’d  just  eaten  spaghetti  off 
of.  I  wanted  to  walk  over 
there  and  take  the  plate — his 
pathetic  excuse  to  distract 
himself — and  throw  it  on  the 


ground.  I  wanted  to  tell  him 
how  stupid  this  whole  thing 
was  with  Mom.  I  wanted  him 
to  realize  what  a  waste  of 
time  these  dumb  depressions 
and  fights  were  and  just  admit 
things  weren’t  working  out. 

But,  of  course,  I  couldn’t. 
All  I  could  say  was,  “Dad. . .” 

He  faced  me,  shaking  his 
head,  a  wet  dishrag  dangling 
from  his  hand.  “Go  out  and 
have  fun,”  he  said. 


“Seriously,  I  want  you  to. 
You’re  only  a  kid  once.” 

There  was  no  arguing. 

That  was  his  subtle  way  of 
telling  me  he  wanted  to  be 
alone. 

“Okay,”  I  said.  “If  you’re 
sure. . .  I’ll  go  call  Casey.” 

I  walked  upstairs  and  into 
my  bedroom.  I  picked  my  cell 
phone  up  off  the  dresser  and 
dialed  Casey’s  number.  Two 
rings  in,  she  answered. 


“Hey,  Casey.  I  changed 
my  mind  about  the  Nest. . . 
and,  um,  do  you  think  it 
would  be  okay  if  I  stayed 
over  tonight?  I’ll  tell  you 
about  it  later,  but  I. . .  I  just 
don’t  want  to  stay  at  home.” 

I  refolded  the  clean 
clothes  on  the  floor  at  the  foot 
of  my  bed  before  I  left,  but  it 
didn’t  help  as  much  as  it 
usually  did.

“Pour  me  another  one,  Joe.”  I 
slid  the  empty  glass  toward 
the  bartender,  who  caught  it 
easily. 

“I’m  cutting  you  off, 
Bianca.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes.  “It’s 
Cherry  Coke.” 


“Which  can  be  just  as 
dangerous  as  whiskey.”  He 
put  the  glass  on  a  counter 
behind  the  bar.  “No  more. 
You’ll  thank  me  later. 
Caffeine  headaches  are  a 
bitch,  and  I  know  how  you 
girls  are.  When  you  gain  five 
pounds,  you’ll  blame  me.” 

“Whatever.”  So  what  if  I 
gained  weight?  I  was  already 
the  Duff,  and  the  one  guy  I 
wanted  to  impress  had  a 


serious  girlfriend.  I  could 
gain  seventy  pounds  and  be 
no  worse  off. 

“Sorry,  Bianca.”  Joe 
moved  to  the  other  end  of  the 
bar,  where  Angela  and  her 
best  friend,  Vikki,  waited  to 
order  drinks. 

I  drummed  my  fingers  on 
the  wooden  surface  of  the 
bar,  my  mind  far  away  from 
the  music  and  strobe  lights. 
Why  hadn’t  I  insisted  on 


staying  home  with  Dad?  Why 
hadn’t  I  just  made  him  talk  to 
me?  I  kept  imagining  him, 
wallowing  in  his  misery. . . 
alone. 

But  that’s  how  we  Pipers 
handled  stress. 

Alone. 

Why  was  that?  Why 
couldn’t  either  of  us  open  up? 
Why  couldn’t  Dad  admit  that 
he  and  Mom  were  having 
issues?  Why  couldn’t  I 


confront  him  about  it? 

“Hello,  Duffy.” 

Why  did  that  jackass  have 
to  sit  next  to  me? 

“Go  away,  Wesley,”  I 
growled,  staring  down  at  my 
restless  fingers. 

“I  can’t,”  he  said.  “You 
see,  Duffy,  I’m  not  one  to 
give  up  easily.  I  am 
determined  to  hook  up  with 
one  of  your  friends — 
preferably  the  one  with  the 


fantastic  rack.” 

“Then  go  talk  to  her,”  I 
suggested. 

“I  would,  but  Wesley 
Rush  doesn’t  chase  girls. 

They  chase  him.”  He  grinned 
at  me.  “It’s  all  right.  She’ll  be 
over  here  begging  me  to  sleep 
with  her  soon.  Talking  to  you 
will  just  speed  up  the  process. 
Until  then,  you  get  the  honor 
of  my  company.  Lucky  for 
me,  it  doesn’t  look  like 


you’re  armed  with  a  beverage 
tonight.”  He  laughed  but 
stopped  suddenly.  I  could  feel 
his  eyes  on  me,  but  I  didn’t 
look  up.  “Are  you  all  right? 
You  don’t  seem  as  aggressive 
as  usual.” 

“Leave  me  alone,  Wesley. 
I’m  serious.” 

“What’s  wrong?” 

“Go  away.” 

The  anxiety  inside  me 
needed  to  escape,  to  be 


released  in  some  way.  I 
couldn’t  wait  until  Casey  and 
I  got  back  to  her  house  to 
vent.  I  needed  to  let  it  out 
right  then.  But  I  didn’t  want 
to  cry,  not  in  front  of  half  the 
school,  and  there  was  no  way 
I  was  going  to  talk  about  it 
with  Joe  or  the  douche  bag 
next  to  me,  and  punching 
someone  would  just  get  me  in 
trouble.  I  couldn’t  see  any 
other  options,  but  I  felt  like 


I’d  explode  if  I  didn’t  let  it 
out  soon. 

Mom  was  in  California. 

Dad  was  drowning. 

I  was  too  much  of  a 
coward  to  do  a  damn  thing 
about  it. 

“There  has  to  be 
something  bothering  you,” 
Wesley  persisted.  “You  look 
like  you  might  cry.”  He  put  a 
hand  on  my  shoulder,  forcing 
me  to  turn  and  face  him. 


“Bianca?” 

Then  I  did  a  really  fucked- 
up  thing.  My  only  excuse  is 
that  I  was  under  an 
unbelievable  amount  of 
stress,  and  I  spotted  an  outlet. 
I  needed  something  to  distract 
me — anything  far  away  from 
my  parents’  drama — just  for  a 
second.  And  when  I  saw  my 
chance  I  didn’t  stop  to  think 
about  how  much  I’d  regret  it 
later.  An  opportunity  sat  on 


the  bar  stool  beside  me,  and  I 
lunged  at  it.  Literally. 

I  kissed  Wesley  Rush. 

One  second  his  hand  lay 
on  my  shoulder,  and  his  gray 
eyes  rested,  for  once,  on  my 
face,  and  the  next  my  mouth 
was  on  his.  My  lips  were 
fierce  with  bottled  emotion, 
and  he  seemed  to  tense,  his 
body  frozen  in  shock.  That 
didn’t  last  very  long.  An 
instant  later,  he  returned  the 


aggression,  his  hands  flying 
to  my  sides  and  pulling  me 
toward  him.  It  felt  like  a 
battle  between  our  mouths. 
My  hands  clawed  into  his 
curly  hair,  tugging  it  way 
harder  than  necessary,  and  his 
fingertips  dug  into  my  waist. 

It  worked  better  than 
punching  someone  would 
have.  Not  only  did  it  help  me 
release  the  agonizing 
pressure,  but  it  definitely 


distracted  me.  I  mean,  it’s 
hard  to  think  about  your  dad 
when  you’re  making  out  with 
somebody. 

And  as  disturbing  as  it 
sounds,  Wesley  was  a  really 
good  kisser.  He  leaned  into 
me,  and  I  tugged  at  him  so 
hard  that  he  nearly  fell  off  his 
bar  stool.  In  that  moment,  we 
just  couldn’t  get  close  enough 
to  each  other.  Our  separate 
seats  seemed  like  they  were 


miles  apart. 

All  of  my  thoughts 
vanished,  and  I  became  a  sort 
of  physical  being.  Emotions 
disappeared.  Nothing  existed 
but  our  bodies,  and  our 
warring  lips  were  at  the 
center  of  everything.  It  was 
bliss!  It  was  amazing  not  to 
think. 

Nothing!  Nothing...  until 
he  screwed  it  up. 

His  hand  slid  up  from  my 


waist,  trailing  along  my  torso, 
and  came  to  a  stop  right  on 
my  boob. 

Everything  flooded  back, 
and  I  suddenly  remembered 
exactly  who  I  was  kissing.  I 
tore  my  hands  out  of  his  hair 
and  shoved  him  away  from 
me  as  hard  as  I  could.  Anger 
— fresh,  hot  anger — surged 
through  me,  completely 
replacing  the  anxious  worry 
I’d  been  feeling  a  minute 


before.  His  hands  dropped, 
one  landing  on  my  knee,  as 
he  pulled  away.  He  looked 
surprised  but  distinctly 
pleased. 

“Wow,  Duffy,  that  was — ” 

And  I  slapped  him.  I 
slapped  him  so  hard,  my  palm 
stung  with  the  contact. 

The  hand  on  my  knee  flew 
to  his  cheek.  “What  the  hell?” 
he  demanded.  “Why  did  you 
do  that?” 


“Asshole!”  I  yelled.  I 
jumped  off  my  stool  and 
stormed  onto  the  dance  floor. 
I  didn’t  want  to  admit  it,  but  I 
was  madder  at  myself  than  at 
him.

Casey’s  queen-size  bed  was 
incredibly  warm.  The  pillows 
were  soft,  and  I  felt  like  I 
could  sink  into  the  fluffy 
mattress  and  live  there 
forever.  But  I  couldn’t  sleep. 

I  tossed  and  turned  on  my 
side  of  the  bed,  trying  not  to 


wake  Casey  up.  I  counted 
sheep.  I  did  that  thing  where 
you  relax  every  part  of  your 
body  from  the  big  toe  up.  I 
even  imagined  one  of  Mr. 
Chaucer’s  rambling  lectures 
on  public  policy. 

Still  wide  awake. 

I  was  bottling  again,  but  it 
had  nothing  to  do  with  Dad 
this  time.  I’d  gotten  that  off 
my  chest  after  Casey  and  I 
had  dropped  Jessica  off 


earlier  that  night. 

“I’m  getting  worried  about 
Dad,”  I’d  told  her.  I’d  waited 
until  Jessica  was  out  of  the 
car  to  talk  about  it.  I  knew 
she  wouldn’t  have 
understood.  Jessica  was  from 
a  happy,  healthy  two-parent 
family.  Casey,  on  the  other 
hand,  had  already  seen  her 
parents’  relationship  crumble. 
“He’s  so  clueless.  I  mean, 
isn’t  it  obvious  that  it  isn’t 


working?  Shouldn’t  they  just 
get  the  fucking  divorce  and 
be  done  with  it?” 

“Don’t  say  that,  B,”  she 
warned.  “Seriously,  don’t 
even  think  that  way.” 

I  shrugged. 

“It’ll  all  work  out,”  she 
said,  reaching  over  and 
squeezing  my  hand  as  we 
sped  toward  her  house.  The 
snow  hadn’t  started  falling 
yet,  but  I  could  see  clouds 


moving  across  the  stars  in  the 
dark  sky  overhead.  “She’ll 
come  home  and  they’ll  talk  it 
through  and  have  makeup  sex 

“God!  Gross,  Casey!” 

“ — and  everything  will  be 
back  to  normal.”  She  paused 
as  I  pulled  into  her  driveway. 
“And  in  the  meantime,  I’m 
here  for  you.  If  you  need  to 
talk,  you  know  I’ll  listen.” 

“Yeah,  I  know.” 


It  was  the  same  Casey 
Saves  the  Day  speech  I’d 
been  hearing  for  twelve  years, 
any  time  the  slightest 
problem  appeared  in  my  life. 
Not  that  I  needed  it  that  night, 
really.  Honestly,  since  we’d 
left  the  Nest,  Dad  hadn’t  been 
on  my  mind  that  much.  I’d 
released  all  that  stress  when 
I’d  kissed  Wesley. 

And  that  was  what  kept 
me  from  sleeping.  I  couldn’t 


stop  thinking  about  what  I’d 
done  at  the  Nest.  My  skin 
itched.  My  lips  felt  foreign. 
Plus,  no  matter  how  many 
times  I’d  brushed  my  teeth  in 
Casey’s  bathroom  (after  half 
an  hour,  she’d  knocked  on  the 
door  to  make  sure  I  was 
okay),  the  taste  of  disgusting, 
womanizing  bastard  was  still 
in  my  mouth.  Ugh!  But  the 
worst  part  was  that  I  knew  I’d 
done  it  to  myself. 


I’d  kissed  him.  Yeah,  he’d 
groped  me,  but  what  had  I 
really  expected?  Wesley  Rush 
didn’t  exactly  have  a 
reputation  for  being  a 
gentleman.  He  might  have 
been  a  jackass,  but  I  had  to 
take  the  blame  for  this 
situation.  That  knowledge 
didn’t  sit  well  with  me. 

“Casey,”  I  whispered. 
Okay,  so  waking  her  up  at 
three  a.m.  wasn’t  very  nice  of 


me,  but  she  was  the  one 
always  telling  me  to  share  or 
vent  or  whatever.  So, 
technically,  she  brought  this 
on  herself.  “Hey,  Casey?” 

“Hmm?’ 

“Are  you  awake?” 

“Mmm-mmm.” 

“If  I  tell  you  something, 
will  you  swear  not  to  tell 
anyone?”  I  asked.  “And  will 
you  promise  not  to  freak 
out?” 


“Sure,  B,”  she  mumbled. 
“What  is  it?” 

“I  kissed  someone 
tonight,”  I  said. 

“Good  for  you.  Now  go 
back  to  sleep.” 

I  took  a  deep  breath.  “It 
was  Wesley. . .  Wesley  Rush.” 

Casey  shot  straight  up  in 
bed.  “Whoa!”  She  shook  her 
head  and  rubbed  the  sleep 
from  her  wide  hazel  eyes. 
“Okay,  now  I’m  awake.”  She 


turned  to  face  me,  her  short 
blond  hair  sticking  up  in 
every  possible  angle.  God, 
how  did  she  manage  to  make 
even  that  look  good?  “OMG! 
What  happened?  I  thought 
you  hated  the  guy.” 

“I  do  hate  him.  I  will 
always  hate  him.  It  was  just  a 
stupid,  immature,  thoughtless 
moment  of. . .  stupidity.”  I  sat 
up  and  hugged  my  knees  to 
my  chest.  “I  feel  dirty.” 


“Dirty  can  be  fun.” 

“Casey.” 

“Sorry,  B,  but  I  don’t  see 
what  the  problem  is,”  she 
admitted.  “He’s  hot.  He’s 
rich.  He’s  probably  a  fantastic 
kisser.  Is  he?  I  mean,  he  has 
those  lips  that  just  make  me 
think — ” 

“Casey!”  I  put  my  hands 
over  my  ears.  “Stop!  Look, 
I’m  totally  not  proud  of  this.  I 
was  upset,  he  was  there,  and  I 


just. . .  God,  I  can’t  believe  I 
did  that.  Does  this  make  me  a 
slut?” 

“Kissing  Wesley? 
Hardly.” 

“What  do  I  do,  Casey?” 

“Kiss  him  again?” 

I  shot  her  a  cold  look 
before  falling  back  onto  my 
pillow.  I  rolled  over  so  that  I 
faced  away  from  her.  “Forget 
it,”  I  said.  “I  shouldn’t  have 
told  you  at  all.” 


“Oh,  B,  don’t  be  like 
that,”  she  said.  “I’m  sorry, 
but  I  think  you  should  look 
on  the  bright  side  for  once  in 
your  life.  I  mean,  you  haven’t 
had  a  boyfriend  since. . .”  She 
trailed  off.  Both  of  us  knew 
the  name,  after  all.  “Anyway, 
it’s  about  time  you  started 
getting  a  little  bit  of  action. 
You  never  talk  to  any  guys 
but  Joe,  and  he’s  way  too  old 
for  you.  And  now  that  we 


know  Toby’s  off  the  market, 
what’s  the  problem  if  you 
date  Wesley?  Would  it  kill 
you?” 

“I  am  not  dating  him,”  I 
hissed.  “Wesley  Rush  doesn’t 
date,  he  fucks — everyone,  for 
that  matter.  I  just  kissed  him, 
and  it  was  so  stupid. . .  stupid, 
stupid,  stupid!  It  was  a  huge 
mistake.” 

She  nestled  back  into  her 
side  of  the  mattress.  “You 


know,  I  knew  even  you 
couldn’t  resist  his  charm 
forever.” 

“Excuse  me,”  I  said, 
rolling  back  over  to  glare  at 
her.  “I’m  resisting  just  fine, 
thanks.  And  you  know  what? 
There’s  nothing  to  resist.  I 
find  him  repulsive.  Tonight 
was  just  a  lapse  in  judgment 
and  it  will  never  happen 
again.” 

“Never  say  never,  B.” 


She  was  snoring  within 
seconds. 

I  grumbled  to  myself  for  a 
few  minutes,  then  fell  asleep, 
inwardly  cursing  both  Casey 
and  Wesley.  Strangely 
enough,  that  was  comforting. 

Dad  had  just  gotten  in  from 
his  job  at  Tech  Plus,  a  local 
rip-off  of  Best  Buy,  when  I 
walked  through  the  door  the 
next  afternoon,  shaking  fresh 


snow  out  of  my  hair.  The 
storm  hadn’t  been  as  big  as 
the  weatherman  predicted, 
but  flurries  were  still  falling 
outside.  The  sun  was  bright, 
though,  so  the  moderate 
dusting  would  be  melted  by 
that  evening.  I  took  off  my 
jacket  and  glanced  over  at 
Dad,  who  was  on  the  couch, 
browsing  through  the 
Hamilton  Journal  with  a  mug 
of  hot  coffee  in  his  left  hand. 


He  looked  up  when  he 
heard  me  come  in.  “Hey, 
Bumblebee,”  he  said,  putting 
his  mug  down  on  the  coffee 
table.  “Did  you  have  fun  with 
Casey  and  Jessica?” 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “How  was 
work?” 

“Busy,”  he  sighed.  “Do 
you  know  how  many  people 
in  this  town  got  laptops  for 
Christmas?  I’m  sure  you 
don’t,  so  I’ll  just  tell  you  that 


a  lot  of  them  did.  Do  you 
know  how  many  of  those 
laptops  were  faulty?” 

“A  lot?”  I  guessed. 

“Bingo.”  Dad  shook  his 
head  and  started  to  fold  up 
the  newspaper.  “If  you  don’t 
have  the  money  to  spend  on  a 
good  laptop,  why  bother?  Just 
save  it  and  buy  a  better  one 
later.  You’ll  just  wind  up 
spending  that  extra  cash  on 
the  repairs  if  you  don’t.  You 


remember  that,  Bumblebee.  If 
I  teach  you  one  thing  in  life, 
let  that  be  it.” 

“Sure,  Dad.” 

Suddenly  I  felt  like  an 
idiot.  How  could  I  have 
gotten  so  worked  up  last 
night?  Clearly  it  was  over 
nothing.  I  mean,  yeah,  he  and 
Mom  were  having  issues,  but 
it  would  probably  blow  over 
like  Casey  said.  He  wasn’t 
depressed  or  sad  or  even 


remotely  close  to  touching  a 
drop  of  alcohol. 

Still,  I  knew  Mom’s  latest 
absence  was  hitting  him  kind 
of  hard.  So  I  figured  I  ought 
to  try  and  make  it  easier  on 
him.  I  knew  he  was  probably 
feeling  a  little  lonely  lately, 
and  I  guess  that  was  partially 
my  fault  too. 

“Wanna  watch  TV?”  I 
asked.  “I  don’t  have  much 
homework  due  tomorrow,  so 


I  can  wait  and  do  it  later.” 

“Sounds  good,”  Dad  said. 
He  swiped  the  remote  from 
the  side  table.  “There’s  a 
rerun  of  an  old  Perry  Mason 
on  right  now.” 

I  grimaced.  “Uh,...  okay.” 
“I’m  kidding, 
Bumblebee,”  he  laughed, 
flipping  through  the  channels. 
“I  wouldn’t  do  that  to  you. 
Let’s  see....  Oh,  look. 

There’s  a  Family  Ties 


marathon  on  TV  Land.  You 
used  to  love  this  show  when 
you  were  little.  You  and  I 
used  to  watch  the  reruns 
when  you  were  about  four.” 

“I  remember.”  I  settled 
onto  the  couch  beside  him.  “I 
told  you  I  wanted  to  be  a 
Young  Republican  because  I 
thought  Michael  J.  Fox  was 
cute.” 

Dad  snorted  and  adjusted 
his  thick-rimmed  glasses. 


“That  didn’t  happen.  My 
Bumblebee’s  a  liberal  now.” 
He  put  an  arm  around  my 
shoulders  and  squeezed.  And 
I  knew  this  was  what  he 
needed.  Or  maybe  we  both 
did.  Just  a  little  bonding  time 
so  that  the  house  didn’t  feel 
quite  so  empty.  I  mean,  I 
loved  the  quiet,  but  too  much 
of  it  might  drive  you  crazy 
after  a  while.  “What  do  you 
say  we  watch  a  few 


episodes?” 

I  smiled.  “Sure,  Dad.” 

About  halfway  into  the 
first  episode,  I  had  this  weird 
revelation.  Okay,  so  when  I 
was  a  kid,  I  had  a  major  crush 
on  Alex  P.  Keaton  (Michael 
J.  Fox’s  super-Republican 
character  on  Family  Ties),  but 
twelve  years  later,  I  was  in 
like  with  Toby  Tucker,  a 
Young  Democrat.  Did  I  have 
a  thing  for  politicians  or 


what?  Maybe  I  was,  like, 
destined  to  be  the  wife  of  a 
senator. . .  or  I  might  wind  up 
being  the  First  Lady. 

Nah.  Politicians  didn’t 
marry  Duffs.  They  didn’t 
look  good  enough  on  the 
sidelines  of  debates.  And  I 
wasn’t  the  marrying  type, 
anyway.  I  had  a  better  shot  of 
being  the  Monica  Lewinsky 
of  the  future.  I’d  just  be  sure 
to  bum  all,  um,  incriminating 


dresses. 

Hey,  Obama  was  kind  of 
sexy  for  an  old  guy.  Maybe  I 
had  a  shot. 

I  bit  my  lip  as  Dad 
laughed  at  one  of  the  sitcom- 
y  jokes.  How  was  it  that  even 
Family  Ties  brought  me  back 
to  that  word? 

Duff. 

God,  Wesley  and  his 
damn  pigeonholing  just 
wouldn’t  leave  me  alone.  The 


word  was  taunting  me,  even 
in  my  own  home.  I  scooted 
closer  to  Dad,  trying  to  focus 
on  the  show.  On  our  time 
together.  On  anything  but 
Wesley  and  that  stupid  label. 

I  tried  to  forget  about  that 
damn  kiss  and  how  idiotic  I’d 
been. 

Tried,  tried,  tried. 

And,  of  course,  failed 
miserably.

When  I  was  in  kindergarten,  I 
had  a  traumatic  monkey  bars 
experience.  I’d  been  halfway 
across,  my  legs  swinging 
beneath  me,  when  my  hands 
got  sweaty  and  made  me  slip. 
I  fell  for  what  seemed  like  a 
mile  before  landing  on  the 


ground  in  a  heap.  All  the 
other  five-year-olds  laughed 
at  me  and  my  scraped,  bloody 
knee.  All  of  them  but  one. 

Casey  Blithe  walked  out 
of  the  gawking  group  of 
grade-schoolers  and  came  to 
stand  in  front  of  me.  Even 
back  then,  I  knew  she  was 
beautiful.  Blond  locks,  hazel 
eyes,  rosy  cheeks. . .  the 
epitome  of  five-year-old 
perfection.  She  could  have 


been  in  pageants. 

“Are  you  okay?”  she 
asked. 

“I’m  fine,”  I  said  through 
thick,  hot  tears.  I  wasn’t  sure 
whether  I  was  crying  because 
of  the  pain  in  my  knee  or 
because  of  the  way  all  my 
classmates  were  laughing  at 
me. 

“No,  you’re  not.  You’re 
bleeding.  Let  me  help.”  She 
reached  out  a  hand  and  pulled 


me  up.  Then  she  turned  and 
yelled  at  the  kids  who  were 
making  fun  of  me. 

After  that,  she  basically 
appointed  herself  my  personal 
caretaker,  never  letting  me 
out  of  her  sight,  determined 
to  keep  me  out  of  trouble. 
From  that  moment  on,  we 
were  best  friends. 

Of  course,  that  was  before 
popularity  and  Duffs  got 
involved.  She  wound  up 


being  tall  (almost  six  one — 
the  girl  was  an  Amazon!)  and 
thin  and  gorgeous.  I  wound 
up  looking  like. . .  well,  the 
opposite.  To  see  us 
separately,  no  one  would  ever 
think  we  were  close.  No  one 
would  guess  the  pretty 
Homecoming  Queen  was 
with  the  chubby  mousy- 
haired  girl  in  the  corner. 

But  we  were  best  friends. 
She’d  been  there  for  me 


through  everything.  She’d 
even  stuck  by  me  freshman 
year,  after  I’d  had  my  heart 
broken  for  the  first — and  if  I 
had  anything  to  do  with  it, 
only — -time.  She  never  let  me 
isolate  myself  or  drown  in  my 
own  misery.  Despite  the  fact 
that  she  could  easily  find 
prettier,  cooler,  more  popular 
friends,  she  stayed  with  me. 

So  when  she  asked  me  to 
drive  her  home  after 


cheerleading  practice  on 
Wednesday  afternoon,  I 
agreed.  I  mean,  after  all  she’d 
done  for  me  over  the  past 
twelve  years,  the  least  I  could 
do  was  give  her  a  lift  every 
now  and  then. 

I  waited  in  the  cafeteria, 
staring  at  the  psychedelic 
blue-and-orange  walls  (the 
guy  who  picked  our  school 
colors  must  have  been  on 
some  serious  drugs), 


attempting  to  finish  my 
calculus  homework.  I  was  in 
the  middle  of  asking  myself 
the  age-old  question — where 
will  I  use  this  in  real  life? — 
when  I  felt  a  hand  on  my 
shoulder.  That  skin-crawly 
thing  happened,  and  I  knew 
exactly  who  was  behind  me. 

Great.  Just  fucking  great. 

I  jerked  out  from  under 
Wesley’s  hand  and  spun 
around  to  face  him,  gripping 


my  pencil  like  a  dart  and 
aiming  it  right  at  his  Adam’s 
apple. 

He  didn’t  even  flinch.  His 
gray  eyes  examined  the 
pencil  with  feigned  curiosity 
and  he  said,  “Interesting.  Is 
this  how  you  greet  all  the 
boys  you  like?” 

“I  don ’t  like  you.” 

“Does  that  mean  you  love 
me,  then?” 

I  hated  the  smooth, 


confident  way  he  spoke.  A  lot 
of  girls  thought  it  was  sexy, 
but  it  was  really  just  stalker- 
ish.  Everything  about  him 
screamed  date  rape!  to  me. 
Ugh. 

“It  means  that  I  hate  you,” 
I  snapped.  “And  if  you  don’t 
stay  the  fuck  away  from  me, 
I’ll  report  you  for  sexual 
harassment.” 

“Might  be  a  hard  case,” 
Wesley  mused.  He  swiped  the 


pencil  from  me  and  began 
twirling  it  between  his 
fingers.  “Especially 
considering  you’re  the  one 
who  kissed  me.  Technically,  I 
could  report  you  for 
harassment.” 

I  gritted  my  teeth,  still 
hating  to  even  think  about  it, 
not  even  bothering  to  remind 
him  that  he’d  been  more  than 
willing  to  participate.  “Give 
me  back  my  pencil,”  I 


muttered. 

“I  don’t  know,”  he  said. 
“With  you,  this  could  be 
classified  as  a  dangerous 
weapon. . .  along  with  glasses 
of  cherry  soda.  Interesting 
choice,  by  the  way.  I’d 
always  pegged  you  for  more 
of  a  Sprite  girl.  You  know. . . 
plain” 

I  just  glared  at  him, 
hoping  he  would 
spontaneously  combust 


before  I  grabbed  my 
textbooks  and  notepads  off 
the  table.  He  dodged  my 
attempt  to  stomp  on  his  foot 
and  stared  after  me  as  I 
marched  down  the  hallway.  I 
was  halfway  to  the  gym, 
where  Casey,  the 
cheerleading  captain,  should 
have  been  wrapping  up 
practice,  when  he  caught  up 
with  me. 

“Oh,  come  on,  Duffy. 


That  was  just  a  joke.  Lighten 
up.” 

“It  wasn’t  funny.” 

“Your  sense  of  humor 
needs  some  work,  then,” 
Wesley  suggested.  “Most 
girls  find  my  jokes 
charming.” 

“Those  girls  must  have 
IQs  low  enough  to  trip  over.” 

He  laughed. 

Apparently,  /  was  the 
funny  one. 


“Hey,  you  never  told  me 
why  you  were  upset  the  other 
night,”  he  said.  “You  were 
too  busy  shoving  your  tongue 
down  my  throat.  So  what  was 
the  problem?” 

“None  of  your — ”  I  began, 
but  I  stopped  suddenly.  “Hey! 
I  didn’t. . .  there  was  no 
tongue!”  A  shiver  of  rage  ran 
through  me  as  I  noticed  his 
mischievous  smile.  “You  son 
of  a  bitch!  Get  the  fuck  out  of 


here.  God,  why  are  you 
stalking  me?  I  thought 
Wesley  Rush  didn’t  chase 
girls.  I  thought  they  chased 
him,  right?” 

“You’re  right.  Wesley 
Rush  doesn’t  chase  girls,  and 
I’m  not  chasing  you,”  he  said. 
“I’m  here  waiting  for  my 
sister.  She’s  making  up  a  test 
for  Mr.  Rollins.  I  just  saw 
you  in  the  cafeteria  and 
thought — ” 


“What?  Thought  you’d 
torture  me  a  little  more?”  I 
clenched  my  fists.  “Leave  me 
the  hell  alone.  You’ve  already 
made  me  miserable.” 

“How  have  I  done  that?” 
he  asked,  sounding  a  little 
surprised. 

I  didn’t  answer.  I  didn’t 
want  to  give  him  the 
satisfaction  of  knowing  that 
Duff  was  plaguing  me 
because  of  him.  He’d  enjoy  it 


too  much. 

Instead,  I  took  off  running 
to  the  gym  doors  as  fast  as  I 
could.  This  time  he  didn’t 
follow  me — thank  God.  I 
hurried  into  the  blue-and- 
orange  gymnasium  (Oh  God. 
Bright  colors. . .  I  could  feel  a 
headache  coming  already. . .  ) 
and  took  a  seat  on  the  closest 
bleacher. 

“Great  practice,  girls!” 
Casey  cried  from  the  other 


side  of  the  gym.  “Okay,  the 
next  basketball  game  is 
Friday.  I  want  you  all  to 
practice  the  dance,  and  Vikki, 
work  on  those  high  kicks.  All 
right?” 

The  Skinny  Squad 
murmured  in  general 
agreement. 

“Awesome,”  said  Casey. 
“See  you  later,  guys.  Go 
Panthers!” 


“Go  Panthers!”  the  other 


cheerleaders  echoed  as  they 
separated.  Most  of  the  girls 
hurried  to  the  locker  room, 
but  a  few  headed  for  the 
doors,  chatting  excitedly  with 
their  friends. 

Casey  skipped  over  to  me. 
“Hey,  B,”  she  said.  “Sorry  we 
went  a  little  overtime.  Do  you 
mind  if  I  change  before  we 
get  out  of  here?  I  feel  a  little 
stinky.” 

“I  don’t  care,”  I 


murmured. 

“What’s  wrong?”  she 
asked,  instantly  suspicious. 

“Nothing,  Casey.  Go 
change.” 

“Bianca,  I  can  tell — ” 

“I  don’t  want  to  talk  about 
it.”  I  wasn’t  about  to  get  into 
another  Wesley  discussion 
with  her.  She’d  probably 
wind  up  defending  him  like 
last  time.  “I’m  fine,  okay?”  I 
said,  softening  my  voice. 


“Long  day.  Headache.” 

Casey  still  looked 
skeptical  when  she  walked, 
with  considerably  less  pep,  to 
the  locker  room. 

Fantastic.  I  felt  like  a  total 
bitch.  She’d  only  wanted  to 
make  sure  I  was  okay,  and  I 
shut  her  out.  I  shouldn’t  have 
taken  my  anger  at  Wesley  out 
on  her,  even  if  she  did  think 
he  was  a  fucking  prince. 

But  when  she  came  out  of 


the  locker  room  in  her  hoodie 
and  jeans,  her  usual  cheer  had 
returned.  She  swung  her 
purse  over  her  shoulder  and 
came  to  where  I  was  sitting,  a 
smile  plastered  across  her 
spotless,  smooth  face. 
“Sometimes,  I  can’t  believe 
the  shit  I  hear  in  the  locker 
room,”  she  said.  “You  ready 
to  go,  B?” 

“Sure.”  I  picked  up  my 
books  and  started  toward  the 


gym  doors,  hoping  that 
Wesley  wasn’t  still  lurking  in 
the  hallway. 

Casey  must  have  noticed 
my  anxiety.  I  could  see  the 
tense,  worried  look  on  her 
face,  but  she  didn’t  bring  it  up 
again.  Instead,  she  said,  “So, 
okay,  Vikki  is  totally  gonna 
get  a  reputation  as  a  whore.” 

“She  already  has  one.” 

“Well,  yeah,”  Casey 
admitted,  “but  it’s  about  to 


get  worse.  She’s  dating  that 
junior  football  player — you 
know,  what’s -his -name — but 
she  told  some  guy  from  Oak 
Hill  High  that  she’d  take  him 
to  Basketball  Homecoming.  I 
don’t  know  why  she  does  this 
stuff  to  herself.  You,  Jess, 
and  me  will  have  a  front-row 
seat  for  the  drama  when  it  all 
comes  out  that  night.  BTW, 
what  are  you  wearing  to  the 
dance?” 


“Nothing.” 

“Hot,  but  I  doubt  they’ll 
let  you  in  naked,  B.”  We 
were  walking  through  the 
maze  of  tables  in  the  cafeteria 
on  our  way  to  the  parking  lot. 

“No.  I  mean,  Jessica  and  I 
aren’t  going  to 
Homecoming,”  I  said. 

“Of  course  you  are,” 
Casey  protested. 

I  shook  my  head.  “Jessica 
is  grounded.  I  promised  her 


I’d  come  over  and  we’d 
watch  girly  movies.” 

Casey  looked  stunned  as 
we  pushed  through  the  blue 
door  and  entered  the  freezing 
student  parking  lot.  “What? 
But  Jess  loves  Basketball 
Homecoming.  It’s  her 
favorite  after  prom  and 
Football  Homecoming.” 

I  smiled  a  little,  in  spite  of 
myself.  “And  Sadie 
Hawkins.” 


“Why  didn’t  I  know  about 
this?  Homecoming  is  getting 
close.  Why  didn’t  you  all  tell 
me?” 

I  shrugged.  “Sorry.  I 
didn’t  even  think  about  it. 
And  I  guess  Jessica  is  still 
moping.  She  might  not  want 
to  talk  about  not  being  able  to 

go-” 

“But. . .  but  who  will  I  go 
to  the  dance  with  now?” 

;Um,  a  boy,”  I  suggested. 


“1 


“Casey,  it’s  not  as  if  it’ll  be 
hard  for  you  to  get  a  date.”  I 
fished  the  car  keys  out  of  my 
back  pocket  and  unlocked  the 
doors  of  my  Saturn. 

“Right,  who  the  hell  wants 
to  go  with  Sasquatch?” 

“You  are  not  Sasquatch.” 

“Besides,”  she  said, 
ignoring  me,  “it’s  way  better 
to  go  with  you  guys.”  She 
climbed  into  the  passenger’s 
seat  and  wrapped  herself  in 


the  blanket  Jessica  had  used  a 
few  nights  earlier.  “Damn  it, 
B.  You  really  need  to  get  that 
fucking  heater  fixed.” 

“You  really  need  to  get 
your  own  car.” 

She  changed  the  subject. 
“Okay,  so  back  to  the  dance. 
If  you  two  aren’t  going. . .  do 
you  guys  care  if  I  crash  your 
movie  fest?  It  could  be  a 
Girls’  Night  In.  We  haven’t 
had  one  of  those  in  a  while.” 


Despite  my  crappy  mood, 

I  smiled.  Casey  was  right.  We 
hadn’t  had  a  movie  night 
together  in  a  long  time,  and  it 
would  be  nice  to  hang  out 
without  the  drama  of  boys  or 
loud  techno  music.  For  once, 

I  might  actually  have  fun  on  a 
Friday  night.  So  I  reached  for 
the  volume  on  my  stereo  and 
said,  “A  week  from  Friday, 
it’s  a  date.” 


6 


When  the  Friday  of  our  Girls’ 
Night  In  finally  rolled  around, 
I  was  more  than  ready  for  a 
nice,  relaxing  evening  with 
my  best  friends — and  the 
wonderfully  Scottish  James 
McAvoy,  of  course.  I’d 
shoved  the  copy  of  Becoming 


Jane  that  Jessica  had  given 
me  for  Christmas,  a  pair  of 
barely  used  pajamas  (yeah,  I 
sleep  naked  at  home — so 
what?),  and  my  toothbrush 
into  my  backpack.  Casey  was 
bringing  the  popcorn,  and 
Jessica  promised  us  big  bowls 
of  chocolate  swirl  ice  cream. 

As  if  my  ass  wasn’t  big 
enough. 

But  naturally,  the  day 
couldn’t  be  all  good.  Mrs. 


Perkins,  my  English  teacher, 
made  sure  of  that  during 
fourth  block. 

“So,  that’s  The  Scarlet 
Letter she  said,  closing  her 
book.  “Did  you  enjoy  it, 
class?” 

There  was  a  low  grumble 
in  the  negative,  but  Mrs. 
Perkins  didn’t  seem  to  notice. 

“Well,  because 
Hawthorne’s  work  is  so 
extraordinary  and  applicable 


to  contemporary  society,  I 
want  each  of  you  to  write  a 
report  pertaining  to  the 
novel.”  She  ignored  the  loud 
sighs.  “The  report  can  be 
about  any  part  of  the  book — a 
character,  a  scene,  a  theme — 
but  I  want  it  to  be  very  well 
thought  out.  I  will  also  be 
allowing  you  to  work  in 
pairs” — the  class  buzzed  with 
excitement — “which  I  will 
assign.”  The  excitement 


vanished. 

I  knew  I  was  in  trouble 
when  Mrs.  Perkins  pulled  out 
her  roll  sheet.  That  meant  she 
would  be  assigning  partners 
based  on  alphabetical  order, 
and  since  there  were  no  kids 
whose  last  names  started  with 
Q  in  that  class,  my  partner 
was  bound  to  be — 

“Bianca  Piper  will  work 
with  Wesley  Rush.” 

Shit. 


I’d  managed  to  steer  clear 
of  Wesley  for  a  week  and  a 
half — since  the  day  he’d 
harassed  me  after  school — 
but  Mrs.  Perkins  had  to  go 
and  screw  that  up. 

She  rattled  off  the  last  few 
names  on  her  list  before 
saying,  “I  expect  the  reports 
to  be  no  fewer  than  five  pages 
long — and  that’s  twelve-point 
font,  double- spaced,  Vikki. 
Don’t  pull  that  stunt  again.” 


She  laughed  good-naturedly. 
“Now,  I  want  partners  to 
work  together.  Both  must 
contribute  to  the  report.  And 
be  creative,  people!  Have 
fun!” 

“Not  likely,”  I  muttered  to 
Jessica,  who  sat  at  the  desk 
next  to  mine. 

“Oh,  I  think  you’re  lucky, 
Bianca,”  she  said.  “I’d  be 
thrilled  if  Wesley  was  my 
partner.  But  my  heart  belongs 


to  Harrison.  It  is  so  unfair  that 
Casey  gets  to  work  with 
him.”  She  glanced  toward 
Casey’s  assigned  seat,  all  the 
way  across  the  classroom. 
“She’ll  probably  get  to  see  his 
house  and  bedroom  and 
everything.  Do  you  think 
she’ll  say  some  good  things 
about  me  if  I  ask?  Maybe 
she’ll  be,  like,  my  wing  girl.” 

I  didn’t  bother  answering. 

“The  reports  are  due  in 


exactly  one  week!”  Mrs. 
Perkins  announced  over  the 
chatter.  “So,  please  work  on 
them  this  weekend.” 

The  bell  rang  and  the 
whole  class  stood  up  at  the 
same  time.  Tiny  Mrs.  Perkins 
scurried  out  of  the  way  to 
avoid  being  trampled  by  the 
stampede  toward  the  door. 
Jessica  and  I  joined  the 
crowd,  and  Casey  caught  up 
to  us  just  as  we  stepped  into 


the  hall. 

“This  is  bullshit,”  she 
hissed.  “An  essay  over 
nothing?  I  don’t  want  to  pick 
a  topic.  That’s  her  freaking 
job!  What  is  the  point  of  this 
damn  assignment  if  she  can’t 
even  give  us  something  to 
write  about?  It’s  ridiculous.” 

“But  you  get  to  work  with 
Harrison,  and — ” 

“Please,  Jess,  don’t  start 
with  that  crap.”  Casey  rolled 


her  eyes.  “He.  Is.  Gay.  It  isn’t 
gonna  happen,  okay?” 

“You  never  know!  So  you 
won’t  play  wing  girl  for  me?” 

“I’ll  meet  you  guys  in  the 
cafeteria,”  I  said,  turning  in 
the  direction  of  my  locker.  “I 
need  to  grab  a  few  things 
first.” 

“Cool.”  Casey  grabbed 
Jessica  by  the  wrist  and 
pulled  her  toward  the  other 
hallway.  “We’ll  meet  you  by 


the  snack  machines,  ’kay,  B? 
Come  on,  Jess.”  And  they  left 
me  alone  in  the  packed 
corridor.  Okay,  not  really 
packed.  Hamilton  High  had 
only  around  four  hundred 
students  or  something,  but 
considering  the  low  numbers, 
the  hallways  seemed  pretty 
crowded  that  afternoon.  Or 
maybe  I  was  just  stressed  out 
and  getting  claustrophobic. 
Anyway,  my  friends  ran 


away,  and  I  was  left  among 
the  beasts. 

I  pushed  my  way  past  the 
loud  jocks  and  smooching 
couples — PDAs  are  so 
disgusting — and  headed  for 
the  science  hallway.  It  took 
only  a  few  minutes  to  get  to 
my  locker,  which,  like  the 
rest  of  the  fugly  school,  was 
painted  orange  and  blue.  I 
spun  my  combination  and 
yanked  open  the  door.  Behind 


me,  a  group  of  cheerleaders 
ran  through  shouting,  “Go 
Panthers!  Panthers! 
Panthers!” 

I’d  just  grabbed  my  coat 
and  backpack  and  was  about 
to  close  the  door  when  he 
showed  up.  Honestly,  I’d 
expected  him  sooner. 

“Looks  like  we’re 
partners,  Duffy.” 

I  kicked  the  locker  shut 
with  a  little  too  much  force. 


“Unfortunately,  yes.” 

Wesley  grinned,  running 
his  fingers  through  his  dark 
curls  as  he  leaned  against  the 
locker  next  to  mine.  “So,  your 
place  or  mine?” 

“What?” 

“To  do  the  assignment  this 
weekend,”  he  said,  narrowing 
his  eyes.  “Don’t  be  getting 
any  ideas,  Duffy.  I’m  not 
chasing  you.  I’m  just  being  a 
good  student.  Wesley  Rush 


•)’) 


doesn’t  chase  girls.  They 

“Chase  you.  Yeah,  I 
know.”  I  pulled  my  coat  on 
over  my  T-shirt.  “If  we  have 
to  do  this,  I  was  thinking 
we’d — ” 

“Wesley!”  A  skinny 
brunette  that  I  didn’t 
recognize  (she  looked  like  a 
freshman)  threw  herself  at 
him  right  in  front  of  me.  She 
stared  up  at  Wesley  with  big 
sappy  eyes.  “Will  you  dance 


with  me  at  Homecoming 
tonight?” 

“Of  course,  Meghan,”  he 
said,  running  his  hand  down 
her  back.  He  was  tall  enough 
to  look  down  her  shirt 
without  any  problem. 
Perverted  bastard.  “I’ll  save  a 
dance  just  for  you,  okay?” 

“Really?” 

“Would  I  lie?” 

“Oh,  thanks,  Wesley!”  He 
bent  down,  and  she  gave  him 


a  quick  kiss  on  the  cheek 
before  scampering  off,  not 
looking  at  me  once. 

Wesley  turned  his 
attention  back  to  me.  “You 
were  saying?” 

Through  gritted  teeth,  I 
growled,  “/  was  thinking  that 
we ’d  meet  at  my  place” 
“What’s  wrong  with  my 
house?”  he  asked.  “Are  you 
afraid  it’s  haunted,  Duffy?” 
“Of  course  not.  I’d  just 


prefer  to  work  at  my  house. 
God  knows  what  kind  of 
diseases  I  could  get  just  by 
stepping  foot  in  your 
bedroom.”  I  shook  my  head. 
“So,  my  house,  okay? 
Tomorrow  afternoon  at,  like, 
three.  Call  before  you  show 
up.” 

I  didn’t  give  him  a  chance 
to  respond.  If  he  had  a 
problem  with  it,  I’d  write  the 
paper  myself.  So,  purposely 


forgetting  to  say  good-bye,  I 
walked  off,  darting  around 
the  groups  of  gossiping  girls 
and  hurrying  toward  the 
cafeteria. 

I  found  Casey  and  Jessica 
waiting  for  me  by  the  old 
vending  machines. 

“I  don’t  get  it,  Case,” 
Jessica  was  saying.  She 
slipped  a  dollar  into  the  only 
working  machine  and  waited 
for  her  Sunkist  to  drop  into 


the  slot  at  the  bottom.  “Don’t 
you  have  to  stay  and  cheer  at 
the  game?” 

“Nope.  I  told  the  girls  that 
I  couldn’t  make  it  tonight,  so 
one  of  our  alternates,  this  cute 
little  freshman,  is  taking  my 
place.  She’s  been  wanting  to 
cheer  all  year,  and  she’s  got 
skills,  but  there  just  hasn’t 
been  a  place  for  her  until 
now.  They’ll  be  fine  without 


me. 


I  was  standing  right  next 
to  them  before  Jessica  spotted 
me.  “There’s  Bianca!  Let’s 
get  the  heck  out  of  here! 
Woohoo!  Girls’  Night  In!” 

Casey  rolled  her  eyes. 

Jessica  pushed  open  the 
blue  door  that  led  to  the 
parking  lot,  smiling  from  ear 
to  ear,  and  said,  “You  guys 
are  the  best.  Like,  really  the 
best.  I  don’t  know  what  I’d 
do  without  you.” 


“Cry  into  your  pillow 
every  single  night,”  Casey 
said. 

“Think  your  other  friends 
were  ‘really  the  best,’  ”  I 
offered,  returning  her  smile. 
There  was  no  fucking  way  I 
was  going  to  let  Wesley  Rush 
drag  me  down.  No  way!  This 
was  Girls’  Night  In,  and  it 
wasn’t  going  to  be  screwed 
up  by  an  asshole  like  him. 
“You  didn’t  forget  that  ice 


cream  promise,  did  you, 
Jessica?” 

“I  remember.  Chocolate 
swirl.” 

We  crossed  the  parking  lot 
and  climbed  into  my  car. 
Instantly,  Jessica  wrapped 
herself  in  the  old  blanket,  and 
Casey,  shivering  visibly, 
glowered  at  her  with  envy  as 
she  pulled  on  her  seat  belt. 
With  a  quick  stomp  on  the 
gas,  we  zoomed  out  of  the 


student  lot  and  hit  the 
highway,  speeding  away  from 
Hamilton  High  like  prisoners 
running  from  their  cells. . . 
which  was  sort  of  what  we 
were. 

“I  can’t  believe  you 
weren’t  nominated  for 
Homecoming  Queen  this 
time,  Casey,”  Jessica  said 
from  the  backseat.  “I  was 
sure  you  would  be.” 

“Nah.  I  got  voted  queen  at 


Football  Homecoming. 
There’s  a  rule  about  people 
winning  more  than  once  in 
the  same  year.  I  wasn’t 
eligible  to  be  nominated  this 
time.  It’s  gonna  be  Vikki  or 
Angela,  I’m  sure.” 

“Do  you  think  they’ll  fight 
if  one  of  them  wins?”  Jessica 
sounded  worried. 

“Doubt  it,”  Casey  said. 
“Angela  couldn’t  care  less 
about  that  kind  of  shit.  Vikki 


is  the  competitive  one. ...  I 
really  was  looking  forward  to 
seeing  the  drama  tonight, 
though.  Did  I  tell  you  that 
Vikki  is  thinking  of  meeting 
up  with  Wesley  Rush,  too?” 

“No!”  Jessica  and  I  cried 
in  unison. 

“Yep,”  Casey  said, 
nodding.  “I  guess  she’s  really 
trying  to  make  her  boyfriend 
jealous  or  something.  She’s 
dating  a  junior,  taking  an 


OHH  kid  to  our  dance,  and 
telling  everyone  she  has  the 
hots  for  Wesley.  She  claims 
they  fooled  around  after  a 
party  recently — I  guess  her 
boyfriend  doesn’t  know  about 
that  yet — and  she’s  thinking 
of  doing  it  again.  She  said  it 
was  amazing.” 

“He  slept  with  her?” 
Jessica  gasped. 

“He  sleeps  with 
everyone,”  I  said,  turning  the 


car  onto  5th  Street.  “If  it  has  a 
vagina,  he’ll  screw  it.” 

“Ew!  Bianca!”  Jessica 
yelped.  “Don’t  say  the. . .  the 
V  word.” 

“Vagina,  vagina,  vagina,” 
Casey  said  flatly.  “Get  over 
it,  Jess.  You  have  one.  You 
can  call  it  what  it  is.” 

Jessica’s  cheeks  were  the 
color  of  tomatoes.  “There’s 
no  reason  to  talk  about  it.  It’s 
crude  and...  personal.” 


Casey  ignored  her  and 
said  to  me,  “He  might  be  a 
player,  but  he’s  pretty  damn 
sexy.  Even  you  have  to  admit 
that,  B.  I  bet  he’s  awesome  in 
bed.  I  mean,  you  made  out 
with  him.  Was  he  amazing? 
Can  you  really  blame  Vikki 
for  wanting  to  hook  up  with 
him?” 

“You  made  out  with 
Wesley?”  Jessica  croaked, 
choking  on  her  own 


excitement.  “What?  When? 
Why  didn’t  you  tell  me?” 

I  shot  a  glare  at  Casey. 
“She’s  embarrassed,” 
Casey  explained,  fluffing  the 
back  of  her  short  pixie  cut. 
“Which  is  dumb  because  I  bet 
she  had  a  blast  kissing  him.” 

“I  did  not  have  a  blast,”  I 
said. 

“Was  he  a  good  kisser?” 
Jessica  asked.  “Tell  me,  tell 
me,  tell  me!  I  really  want  to 


know.” 

“Yes,  if  you  must  know, 
he  was.  But  that  doesn’t  make 
it  any  less  disgusting.” 

“But,”  Casey  interjected, 
“with  your  experience, 
answer  my  last  question.  Can 
you  really  blame  Vikki  for 
wanting  to  hook  up  with 
him?” 

“I  don’t  have  to.”  I 
switched  on  my  turn  signal. 
“She’ll  blame  herself  when 


she  gets  a  venereal  disease. . . 
or  when  her  boyfriend  finds 
out  about  it.  Whichever 
comes  first.” 

“And  this  is  exactly  why  I 
wanted  to  go  to  the  dance,” 
Casey  sighed.  “We  could 
have  witnessed  it  all 
firsthand...  like  Hamilton’s 
own  episode  of  Gossip  Girl. 
Vikki’s  boyfriend  would  be 
getting  pissed  and  plotting 
revenge  as  his  unfaithful 


girlfriend  screws  the  hottest 
guy  in  school,  and  Bianca, 
hiding  her  secret  love  for 
Wesley,  would  mope  and 
pretend  to  hate  him  while 
silently  pining  for  his  super- 
sexy-hot  kiss  again.” 

My  j  aw  dropped  open.  “I 
would  not  be  pining  for 
anything  of  the  sort!” 

Jessica  snorted  with 
laughter  from  the  backseat, 
pulling  her  ponytail  in  front 


of  her  mouth  to  hide  a  grin 
when  I  scowled  at  her  in  the 
rearview. 

“Oh  well,”  Casey  sighed. 
“I’m  sure  we’ll  hear  all  about 
the  drama  on  Monday.” 

“Or  tomorrow  if  the  story 
is  good  enough,”  Jessica  said. 
“Angela  and  Jeanine  never 
keep  gossip  to  themselves.  If 
it  gets  crazy,  you  know 
they’ll  call  us  and  tell  us  what 
we  missed.  I’m  sure  that  they 


will.”  She  smiled.  “I  hope 
they  give  lots  of  details.  I 
can’t  believe  I’m  missing  my 
last  Homecoming.” 

“At  least  you’re  not 
missing  it  alone,  Jess.” 

A  few  seconds  after 
pulling  onto  Holbrooke  Lane, 
I  turned  into  the  Gaithers’ 
driveway.  Yanking  the  keys 
from  the  ignition,  I  said,  “Let 
the  Girls’  Night  In  officially 
begin.” 


“Woohoo!”  Jessica 
jumped  out  of  the  backseat 
and  practically  danced  up  to 
her  front  porch.  She  pushed 
open  the  door,  and  Casey  and 
I  followed  her  inside,  shaking 
our  heads  with  amusement. 

I  slid  off  my  jacket  and 
hung  it  on  the  hook  just 
inside  the  door.  Jessica  lived 
in  a  coatrack  house — clean, 
neat,  shoes  off  at  the  front 
door. . .  you  know  the  type. 


Her  parents  were  super-picky 
about  order.  Casey  did  the 
same  and  said,  “I  wish  my 
mom  could  keep  a  house  this 
nice.  Or  she  could  at  least 
hire  a  maid  or  whatever.  Our 
place  looks  like  shit.” 

Mine  didn’t  look  that 
great  either.  My  mom  had 
never  been  much  of  a  clean 
freak,  and  Dad  only  believed 
in  cleaning  once  a  year, 
during  the  spring.  Other  than 


laundry,  dishes,  and  the 
occasional  dust-and-vacuum 
job  (usually  all  my  doing), 
not  much  housework  got 
done  in  the  Piper  home. 

“What  time  will  your 
parents  get  here,  Jessica?”  I 
asked. 

“Mom  will  be  home  at 
five-thirty,  and  Dad  should 
get  here  a  little  after  six.”  She 
was  waiting  for  us  at  the  foot 
of  the  stairs,  ready  to  run  up 


to  her  bedroom  as  soon  as  we 
joined  her.  “Dad  started 
seeing  a  new  patient  today, 
though,  so  he  might  be  a  little 
late.” 

Mr.  Gaither  was  a 
therapist.  More  than  once, 
Casey  had  threatened  to  ask 
him  if  he’d  take  me  as  a 
patient  for  free.  See  if  he’d 
help  work  out  my  “issues.” 
Not  that  I  had  issues.  But 
Casey  said  my  cynicism  was 


the  result  of  some  kind  of 
internal  struggle.  I  said  it  was 
just  me  being  intelligent.  And 
Jessica. . .  well,  Jessica  didn’t 
say  anything.  Even  though  it 
was  only  ever  discussed 
teasingly,  she  always  got  a 
little  awkward  when  the 
subject  came  up.  With  all  the 
psychobabble  she  heard  from 
her  dad,  she  probably  did 
think  my  constant  negativity 
was  part  of  an  internal 


struggle. 

Jessica  hated  negativity. 
Hated  it  so  much,  in  fact,  that 
she  wouldn’t  even  say  she 
hated  it.  That  would  have 
been  too  negative. 

“Hurry,  hurry!  Are  you 
guys  ready  or  what?” 

“Let’s  get  this  party 
started!”  Casey  whooped, 
running  past  Jessica  and 
speeding  up  the  stairs. 

Jessica  giggled  like  a 


maniac  as  she  made  an  effort 
to  catch  up  with  Casey,  but  I 
lagged  behind,  following 
them  up  the  stairs  at  a  regular 
walking  pace.  Once  I  reached 
the  landing,  I  could  hear  my 
friends  laughing  and  talking 
in  the  bedroom  at  the  end  of 
the  hall,  but  I  didn’t  follow 
their  voices.  Something  else 
caught  my  attention  first. 

The  door  to  the  first 
bedroom,  the  one  on  the  left, 


was  wide  open.  My  brain  told 
me  to  walk  right  past,  but  my 
feet  weren’t  listening.  I  stood 
in  the  open  doorway,  willing 
my  eyes  to  look  away.  My 
body  just  didn’t  want  to 
cooperate. 

Perfectly  made  bed  with 
the  battered,  navy  blue 
comforter.  Superhero  posters 
covering  every  inch  of  wall. 
Black  light  over  the 
headboard.  The  room  was 


almost  exactly  the  way  I’d 
remembered  it,  only  there 
were  no  dirty  clothes  on  the 
floor.  The  open  closet  looked 
empty,  and  the  Spider-Man 
calendar,  which  used  to  hang 
over  the  computer  desk,  had 
been  taken  down.  But  the 
room  still  seemed  warm,  as  if 
he  were  still  there.  As  if  I 
were  still  fourteen. 

“Jake,  I  don ’t  understand. 
Who  was  that  girl?  ” 


“No  one.  Don ’t  worry 
about  it.  She  doesn  ’t  mean 
anything  to  me.” 


“But...” 

“ Shh ....  It’s  not  a 


deal.  ” 


“I  love  you,  Jake.  Don ’t 
lie  to  me,  okay?  ” 

“I  wouldn  ’t.  ” 

“Promise?  ” 

“Of  course.  Do  you  really 
think  Pd  hurt  you,  Bi — ” 
“Bianca!  Where  the  hell 


did  you  go?” 

Casey’s  voice  made  me 
jump.  Quickly,  I  stepped  out 
of  the  bedroom  and  shut  the 
door,  knowing  that  I  couldn’t 
walk  past  it  every  time  I 
needed  to  pee  that  night. 
“Coming!”  I  managed  to  keep 
my  voice  normal.  “God!  Be 
patient  for  once  in  your  life.” 

Then,  with  a  forced  smile, 
I  went  to  watch  a  movie  with 
my  friends. 


7 


After  thinking  about  it  for  a 
while,  I  decided  that  there 
were  a  lot  of  benefits  to  being 
the  Duff. 

Benefit  one:  no  point  in 
worrying  about  your  hair  or 
makeup. 

Benefit  two:  no  pressure 


to  act  cool — you’re  not  the 
one  being  watched. 

Benefit  three:  no  boy 
drama. 

I  figured  out  benefit  three 
while  we  were  watching 
Atonement  in  Jessica’s 
bedroom.  In  the  movie,  poor 
Keira  Knightley  has  to  go 
through  all  of  this  damn 
tragedy  with  James  McAvoy, 
but  if  she’d  been  unattractive, 
he  never  would  have  looked 


at  her.  She  wouldn’t  have 
gotten  her  heart  broken.  After 
all,  everybody  knows  the  “it’s 
better  to  have  loved  and 
lost. . .”  spiel  is  a  load  of  crap. 

The  theory  applies  to  a  lot 
of  movies,  too.  Think  about 
it.  If  Kate  Winslet  had  been 
the  Duff,  Leonardo  DiCaprio 
wouldn’t  have  been  after  her 
in  Titanic,  and  that  could 
have  saved  all  of  us  a  lot  of 
tears.  If  Nicole  Kidman  had 


been  ugly  in  Cold  Mountain, 
she  wouldn’t  have  had  to 
worry  about  Jude  Law  when 
he  went  off  to  war.  The  list 
goes  on  forever. 

I  watched  my  friends  go 
through  boy  drama  all  the 
time.  Usually,  the 
relationships  ended  with  them 
crying  (Jessica)  or  screaming 
(Casey).  I’d  only  had  my 
heart  broken  once,  but  that 
was  more  than  enough.  So 


really,  watching  Atonement 
with  my  friends  made  me 
realize  how  thankful  I  should 
have  been  to  be  the  Duff. 
Pretty  screwed  up,  right? 

Unfortunately,  being  the 
Duff  didn’t  save  me  from 
experiencing  family  drama. 

I  got  home  at  around  one- 
thirty  the  next  afternoon.  I 
was  still  recovering  from  the 
sleepover — where  no  one 
slept — and  I  could  barely 


keep  my  eyes  open.  The  sight 
of  my  house  in  a  state  of 
complete  devastation  woke 
me  right  up,  though.  Broken 
glass  sparkled  on  the  living 
room  floor,  the  coffee  table 
was  upside  down,  like  it’d 
been  kicked  over,  and — it 
took  me  a  minute  to  register 
this — beer  bottles  were 
scattered  around  the  room. 
For  a  second  I  stood  frozen  in 
the  door,  worried  that  there ’d 


been  a  burglary.  Then  I  heard 
Dad’s  heavy  snoring  in  his 
bedroom  down  the  hall,  and  I 
knew  the  truth  was  worse. 

We  didn’t  live  in  a 
coatrack  home,  so  it  was 
perfectly  acceptable  to  keep 
your  shoes  on  when  you 
walked  on  the  carpet.  Today 
it  was  pretty  much  required. 
Glass,  which  I  figured  out 
had  come  from  several 
broken  picture  frames, 


crunched  under  my  feet  as  I 
made  my  way  to  the  kitchen 
to  get  a  trash  bag — one  would 
be  necessary  to  clean  up  this 
chaos. 

I  felt  oddly  numb  as  I 
moved  through  the  house.  I 
knew  I  should  be  freaking 
out.  I  mean,  Dad  had  been 
sober  for  almost  eighteen 
years,  and  the  beer  bottles 
made  it  pretty  fucking  clear 
that  that  sobriety  was  in 


danger.  But  I  didn’t  feel 
anything.  Maybe  because  I 
didn’t  know  how  to  feel. 
What  could  have  been  bad 
enough  to  knock  him  off  that 
wagon  after  so  long? 

I  found  the  answer  on  the 
kitchen  table,  neatly  masked 
by  a  manila  envelope. 

“Divorce  papers,”  I 
muttered  as  I  examined  the 
contents  of  the  opened 
package.  “What  the  fuck?”  I 


stared  down  at  my  mother’s 
loopy  signature  in  a  twisted 
state  of  shock.  I  mean,  yeah, 
I’d  kind  of  seen  the  end 
coming — when  your  mom 
vanishes  for  more  than  two 
months,  you  just  get  that 
feeling — but  now?  Really? 
She  hadn’t  even  called  to 
warn  me!  Or  Dad.  “Damn  it,” 
I  whispered,  my  fingers 
shaking.  Dad  hadn’t  seen  this 
coming.  God,  no  wonder  he 


was  suddenly  boozing  it  up. 
How  could  Mom  do  this  to 
him?  To  either  of  us. 

Fuck  this.  Seriously.  Fuck 
her. 

I  tossed  the  envelope  aside 
and  went  to  the  cabinet  where 
we  kept  the  cleaning  supplies, 
fighting  the  tears  that  stung 
my  eyes.  I  grabbed  a  garbage 
bag  and  headed  into  the 
demolished  living  room. 

It  hit  me  all  at  once, 


causing  a  lump  to  rise  in  my 
throat  as  I  reached  for  one  of 
the  empty  beer  bottles. 

Mom  wasn’t  coming 
home.  Dad  was  drinking 
again.  And  I  was  literally 
picking  up  the  pieces.  I 
gathered  the  largest  shards  of 
glass  and  the  empty  bottles 
and  tossed  them  into  the  bag, 
trying  not  to  think  about  my 
mom.  Trying  not  to  think 
about  how  she  most  likely 


had  a  perfect  tan.  Trying  not 
to  think  of  the  cute  twenty- 
two-year-old  Latino  she  was 
probably  screwing.  Trying 
not  to  think  about  the  perfect 
signature  she’d  used  on  those 
divorce  papers. 

I  was  angry  at  her.  So,  so 
angry.  How  could  she  do 
this?  How  could  she  just  send 
divorce  papers?  Without 
coming  home  or  warning  us. 
Didn’t  she  know  what  it 


would  do  to  Dad?  And  she 
hadn’t  even  thought  of  me. 
Let  alone  called  to  prepare 
me  for  this. 

Right  then,  while  I  made 
my  way  around  the  living 
room,  I  decided  that  I  hated 
my  mother.  Hated  her  for 
always  being  gone.  Hated  her 
for  shocking  us  with  those 
papers.  Hated  her  for  hurting 
Dad. 

As  I  carried  the  trash  bag 


full  of  destroyed  picture 
frames  into  the  kitchen,  I 
wondered  if  Dad  had 
managed  to  break  those 
memories — the  ones  of  him 
and  Mom  that  the  photos  had 
captured.  Probably  not. 

That’s  why  he’d  needed  the 
alcohol.  When  even  that 
hadn’t  erased  my  mother’s 
face  from  his  mind,  he  must 
have  thrashed  around  the 
room  like  a  drunken  madman. 


I’d  never  seen  my  father 
drunk,  but  I  knew  why  he’d 
quit.  I’d  overheard  him  and 
Mom  talking  about  it  a  few 
times  when  I  was  little. 
Apparently  Dad  had  a  bad 
temper  when  he  was 
smashed.  So  bad  that  Mom 
had  gotten  scared  and  begged 
him  to  quit.  Which  I  guess 
explained  the  overturned 
coffee  table. 

But  the  idea  of  my  father 


drunk. . .  it  just  didn’t 
compute.  I  mean,  I  couldn’t 
even  imagine  him  using  a 
swear  word  more  offensive 
than  damn.  But  a  bad  temper? 
I  couldn’t  picture  it. 

I  just  hoped  he  hadn’t  cut 
himself  on  any  of  the  glass.  I 
mean,  I  didn’t  blame  him  for 
this.  I  blamed  Mom.  She’d 
done  this  to  him.  Leaving, 
disappearing,  not  calling,  no 
warning.  He  never  would 


have  relapsed  if  he  hadn’t 
seen  those  stupid  papers.  He 
would  have  been  fine. 
Watching  TV  Land  and 
reading  the  Hamilton 
Journal.  Not  sleeping  off  a 
hangover. 

I  kept  telling  myself  not  to 
cry  as  I  sat  the  coffee  table 
back  up  and  vacuumed  the 
smaller  pieces  of  glass  out  of 
the  carpet.  I  couldn’t  cry.  If 
I’d  cried,  it  wouldn’t  have 


had  anything  to  do  with  the 
fact  that  my  parents  were 
getting  divorced.  That  wasn’t 
a  shocker.  It  wouldn’t  have 
had  anything  to  do  with 
missing  my  mother.  She’d 
been  gone  too  long  for  that.  I 
wouldn’t  even  have  been 
mourning  for  the  family  I’d 
once  had.  I  was  happy  with 
the  way  life  was,  just  me  and 
Dad.  No.  If  I  had  cried,  it 
would  have  been  out  of 


anger,  out  of  fear,  or 
something  else  entirely 
selfish.  I  would  have  been 
crying  because  of  what  it 
meant  for  me.  I  had  to  be  the 
adult  now.  /  had  to  take  care 
of  Dad.  But  at  that  moment, 
my  mother,  living  like  a  star 
in  Orange  County,  was  acting 
selfishly  enough  for  the  both 
of  us,  so  I  had  to  put  the  tears 
aside. 

I’d  just  rolled  the  vacuum 


back  into  the  laundry  room 
when  the  cordless  phone 
started  ringing. 

“Hello?”  I  said  into  the 
receiver. 

“Good  afternoon,  Duffy.” 

Oh,  shit.  I’d  forgotten 
about  working  with  Wesley 
on  that  stupid  project.  Of  all 
the  people  to  see  that  day, 
why  did  it  have  to  be  him? 
Why  did  this  day  have  to  get 
worse? 


“It’s  almost  three,”  he 
said.  “I’m  getting  ready  to 
drive  over  to  your  place.  You 
told  me  to  call  before  I  left. 
I’m  just  being  considerate.” 

“You  don’t  even  know 
what  that  means.”  I  glanced 
down  the  hall  in  the  direction 
of  my  father’s  snores.  The 
living  room,  while  no  longer 
a  death  trap,  still  looked 
rough,  and  there  was  no 
telling  what  kind  of  mood 


Dad  would  be  in  when  he 
rolled  out  of  bed.  I  just  knew 
it  probably  wouldn’t  be  a 
good  one.  I  didn’t  even  know 
what  I  would  say  to  him. 
“Look,  on  second  thought, 
I’ll  come  to  your  house.  I’ll 
see  you  in  twenty  minutes.” 

Every  town  has  that  one 
house.  You  know,  the  one 
that  is  so  freaking  nice  that  it 
just  doesn’t  fit  in.  The  house 


that’s  so  lavish  that  you 
almost  feel  like  the  owners 
are  rubbing  their  wealth  in 
your  face.  Every  town  in  the 
world  has  one  particular 
house  like  that,  and  in 
Hamilton  that  house  belonged 
to  the  Rush  family. 

I  don’t  know  if  it  could 
technically  be  called  a 
mansion,  but  the  house  was 
three  stories  tall  and  had  two 
balconies.  Balconies!  I’d 


gawked  at  the  place  a  million 
times  as  I  drove  past,  but  I 
never  thought  I’d  be  going 
inside.  On  any  other  day,  I 
would  have  been  a  little 
excited  to  see  the  interior  (of 
course,  I  never  would  have 
told  anyone  that),  but  my 
thoughts  were  so  wrapped 
around  the  divorce  papers  on 
my  kitchen  table  that  I 
couldn’t  feel  anything  but 
anxious  and  miserable. 


Wesley  met  me  at  the 
front  door,  an  annoyingly 
confident  grin  on  his  face.  He 
leaned  against  the  door  frame, 
arms  folded  across  his  broad 
chest.  He  was  wearing  a  dark 
blue  button-down  shirt  with 
the  sleeves  rolled  up  to  his 
elbows.  And  of  course  he’d 
left  the  top  few  buttons 
undone.  “Hello,  Duffy.” 

Did  he  know  how  much 
that  name  bothered  me?  I 


glanced  at  the  driveway, 
which  was  empty  except  for 
my  Saturn  and  his  Porsche. 
“Where  are  your  parents?”  I 
asked. 

“Gone,”  he  replied  with  a 
wink.  “Looks  like  it’s  just 
you  and  me.” 

I  pushed  past  him  and 
walked  into  the  large  foyer, 
rolling  my  eyes  with  disgust. 
Once  my  shoes  were 
positioned  neatly  in  the 


corner,  I  turned  to  Wesley, 
who  was  watching  me  with 
vague  interest.  “Let’s  get  this 
over  with.” 

“Don’t  you  want  the  grand 
tour?” 

“Not  really.” 

Wesley  shrugged.  “It’s 
your  loss.  Follow  me.”  He  led 
the  way  into  the  enormous 
living  room,  which  was 
probably  as  big  as  Hamilton 
High’s  cafeteria.  Two  large 


pillars  held  up  the  ceiling, 
and  three  beige  couches, 
along  with  two  matching  love 
seats,  were  arranged  around 
the  room.  On  one  wall  I  saw  a 
huge  flat-screen  TV,  and  on 
another  I  found  a  giant 
fireplace.  January  sun  spilled 
in  through  the  floor-to-ceiling 
windows,  lighting  the  space 
with  a  natural,  happy  feeling. 
But  Wesley  turned  and 
started  walking  up  the  stairs, 


away  from  the  comforting 
room. 

“Where  are  you  going?”  I 
demanded. 

He  looked  over  his 
shoulder  at  me  with  an 
exasperated  sigh.  “To  my 
room,  of  course.” 

“Can’t  we  write  the  paper 
down  here?”  I  asked. 

The  corners  of  Wesley’s 
mouth  turned  slightly  upward 
as  he  hooked  a  finger  over  his 


belt.  “We  could,  Duffy,  but 
the  writing  will  go  much 
faster  if  I’m  typing,  and  my 
computer’s  upstairs.  You’re 
the  one  who  said  you  wanted 
to  get  this  over  with.” 

I  groaned  and  stomped  up 
the  stairs.  “Fine.” 

Wesley’s  bedroom  was  on 
the  top  floor — one  of  the 
rooms  with  a  balcony — and  it 
was  bigger  than  my  living 
room.  His  king-size  bed 


hadn’t  been  made  yet,  and 
video  game  cases  were 
scattered  on  the  floor  beside 
his  PlayStation  3,  which  was 
hooked  into  a  big-screen  TV. 
Surprisingly,  the  room 
smelled  nice.  It  was  a  mixture 
of  Wesley’s  Burberry  cologne 
and  recently  washed  clothes, 
like  he’d  just  put  laundry 
away  or  something.  The 
bookshelf  that  he  walked 
toward  overflowed  with 


books  by  different  authors, 
from  James  Patterson  to 
Henry  Fielding. 

Wesley  bent  over  at  the 
waist  to  look  at  the  bookshelf, 
and  I  looked  away  from  his 
Diesels  as  he  pulled  his  own 
copy  of  The  Scarlet  Letter  off 
the  shelf  and  moved  to  sit  on 
his  bed.  He  gestured  for  me  to 
join  him,  and  I  did, 
reluctantly.  “Okay,”  he  said, 
thumbing  absently  through 


his  hardcover  book.  “What 
should  we  write  the  paper  on? 
Any  ideas?” 

“I  don’t — ” 

“I  was  thinking  we  could 
do  an  analysis  of  Hester,”  he 
suggested.  “It  sounds  cliche, 
but  I  mean  an  in-depth 
characterization.  Mainly,  why 
did  she  have  the  affair?  Why 
did  she  sleep  with 
Dimmesdale?  Did  she  love 
him,  or  was  she  just 


promiscuous?” 

I  rolled  my  eyes.  “Oh  my 
God,  do  you  always  go  for 
the  simplest  answer?  Hester 
is  way  more  complicated  than 
that.  Neither  of  those  choices 
shows  any  imagination.” 

Wesley  looked  at  me  with 
one  raised  eyebrow.  “All 
right,”  he  said  slowly.  “If 
you’re  so  smart,  then  why  did 
she  do  it?  Enlighten  me.” 

“For  distraction.” 


Okay,  so  maybe  it  was  a 
little  far-fetched,  but  I  just 
kept  seeing  that  damn  manila 
envelope.  Thinking  of  my 
selfish  bitch  of  a  mother.  I 
kept  wondering  what  my 
father  was  like  drunk  for  the 
first  time  in  eighteen  years. 
My  mind  searched  for 
anything — anything —  that 
would  distract  me  from  the 
painful  thoughts,  so  would  it 
be  too  ridiculous  to  think  that 


Hester  felt  the  same  way?  She 
was  lonely,  surrounded  by 
hypocritical  Puritans,  and 
married  to  a  completely 
creepy,  absentee  English  guy. 

“She  just  wanted 
something  to  get  her  mind  off 
the  bad  shit  in  her  life,”  I 
mumbled.  “Some  way  to 
escape...” 

“If  that’s  the  case,  that 
didn’t  go  well  for  her.  It  all 
backfired  in  the  end.” 


I  didn’t  really  hear  him. 
My  mind  was  rushing  back  to 
a  night  not  long  ago,  a  night 
when  I’d  found  a  way  to  push 
my  worries  out  of  my  head.  I 
remembered  the  way  my 
thoughts  had  gone  silent, 
letting  my  body  take  over.  I 
remembered  the  bliss  of 
nothingness.  I  remembered 
how,  even  after  it  ended,  I’d 
been  so  focused  on  what  I’d 
done  that  my  other  worries 


barely  existed. 

.  so  I  guess  that  idea 
could  make  sense.  It’s 
definitely  a  different  angle, 
and  Perkins  likes  creativity. 
We  might  get  an  A.”  Wesley 
turned  to  look  at  me,  and  his 
expression  grew  suddenly 
concerned.  “Duffy,  are  you 
okay?  You’re  staring  off  into 
space.” 

“Don’t  call  me  Duffy.” 

“Fine.  Are  you  okay,  Bian 


_ ?” 

Before  he  could  say  my 
name,  I  closed  the  space 
between  us.  Quickly,  my  lips 
moved  against  his.  The 
mental  and  emotional 
emptiness  took  over  instantly, 
but  physically,  I  was  more 
alert  than  ever.  Wesley’s 
surprise  didn’t  last  as  long  as 
it  had  before,  and  his  hands 
were  on  me  in  seconds.  My 
fingers  tangled  in  his  soft 


hair,  and  Wesley’s  tongue 
darted  into  my  mouth  and 
became  a  new  weapon  in  our 
war. 

Once  again,  my  body  took 
complete  control  of 
everything.  Nothing  existed 
at  the  comers  of  my  mind;  no 
irritating  thoughts  harassed 
me.  Even  the  sounds  of 
Wesley’s  stereo,  which  had 
been  playing  some  piano  rock 
I  didn’t  recognize,  faded 


away  as  my  sense  of  touch 
heightened. 

I  was  fully  conscious  of 
Wesley’s  hand  as  it  slid  up 
my  torso  and  moved  to  cup 
my  breast.  With  an  effort,  I 
pushed  him  away  from  me. 
His  eyes  were  wide  as  he 
leaned  back.  “Please  don’t 
slap  me  again,”  he  said. 

“Shut  up.” 

I  could  have  stopped 
there.  I  could  have  stood  up 


and  left  the  room.  I  could 
have  let  that  kiss  be  the  end 
of  it.  But  I  didn’t.  The  mind- 
numbing  sensation  I  got  from 
kissing  him  was  so  euphoric 
— such  a  high — that  I 
couldn’t  stand  to  give  it  up 
that  fast.  I  might  have  hated 
Wesley  Rush,  but  he  held  the 
key  to  my  escape,  and  at  that 
moment  I  wanted  him. ...  I 
needed  him. 

Without  speaking,  without 


hesitating,  I  pulled  my  T-shirt 
over  my  head  and  threw  it 
onto  Wesley’s  bedroom  floor. 
He  didn’t  have  a  chance  to 
say  anything  before  I  put  my 
hands  on  his  shoulders  and 
shoved  him  onto  his  back.  A 
second  later,  I  was  straddling 
him  and  we  were  kissing 
again.  His  fingers  undid  the 
clasp  on  my  bra,  and  it  joined 
my  shirt  on  the  floor. 

I  didn’t  care.  I  didn’t  feel 


self-conscious  or  shy.  I  mean, 
he  already  knew  I  was  the 
Duff,  and  it  wasn’t  like  I  had 
to  impress  him. 

I  unbuttoned  his  shirt  as 
he  pulled  the  alligator  clip 
from  my  hair  and  let  the 
auburn  waves  fall  around  us. 
Casey  had  been  right.  Wesley 
had  a  great  body.  The  skin 
pulled  tight  over  his  sculpted 
chest,  and  my  hands  drifted 
down  his  muscular  arms  with 


amazement. 

His  lips  moved  to  my 
neck,  giving  me  a  moment  to 
breathe.  I  could  only  smell 
his  cologne  this  close  to  him. 
As  his  mouth  traveled  down 
my  shoulder,  a  thought 
pushed  through  the 
exhilaration.  I  wondered  why 
he  hadn’t  shoved  me — Duffy 
— away  in  disgust. 

Then  again,  I  realized, 
Wesley  wasn’t  known  for 


rejecting  girls.  And  /  was  the 
one  who  should  have  been 
disgusted. 

But  his  mouth  pressed  into 
mine  again,  and  that  tiny, 
fleeting  thought  died.  Acting 
on  instinct,  I  pulled  on 
Wesley’s  lower  lip  with  my 
teeth,  and  he  moaned  quietly. 
His  hands  moved  over  my 
ribs,  sending  chills  up  my 
spine.  Bliss.  Pure, 
unadulterated  bliss. 


Only  once,  as  Wesley 
flipped  me  onto  my  back,  did 
I  seriously  consider  stopping. 
He  looked  down  at  me,  and 
his  skilled  hand  grasped  the 
zipper  on  my  jeans.  My 
dormant  brain  stirred,  and  I 
asked  myself  if  things  had 
gone  too  far.  I  thought  about 
pushing  him  away,  ending  it 
right  where  we  were.  But 
why  would  I  stop  now?  What 
did  I  stand  to  lose?  Yet  what 


could  I  possibly  gain?  How 
would  I  feel  about  this  in  an 
hour. . .  or  sooner? 

Before  I  could  come  up 
with  any  answers,  Wesley 
had  my  jeans  and  underwear 
off.  He  pulled  a  condom  from 
his  pocket  (okay,  now  that 
I’m  thinking  about  it,  who 
keeps  condoms  in  their 
pockets?  Wallet,  yes,  but 
pocket?  Pretty  presumptuous, 
don’t  you  think?),  and  then 


his  pants  were  on  the  floor, 
too.  All  of  a  sudden,  we  were 
having  sex,  and  my  thoughts 
were  muted  again. 


8 


I  was  only  fourteen  when  I 
lost  my  virginity  to  Jake 
Gaither.  He’d  recently  turned 
eighteen,  and  I  knew 
perfectly  well  that  he  was  too 
old  for  me.  Still,  as  a 
freshman  in  high  school,  I 
just  wanted  a  boyfriend.  I 


wanted  to  be  liked  and  to  fit 
in,  and  Jake  was  a  senior  with 
a  car.  At  the  time,  I  thought 
of  that  as  perfection. 

In  the  three  months  we 
were  together,  Jake  never 
took  me  out  on  a  real  date. 
Once  or  twice,  we  made  out 
in  the  back  of  a  dark  movie 
theater,  but  we  never  went 
out  to  dinner  or  bowling  or 
anything  like  that.  We  spent 
most  of  our  time  sneaking 


around  so  that  our  parents  and 
his  sister,  who  later  became 
one  of  my  best  friends, 
wouldn’t  find  out  about  us.  I 
actually  found  that  part,  the 
secrecy,  fun  and  sexy.  It  was 
like  a  forbidden  romance — 
like  Romeo  and  Juliet,  which 
I’d  read  in  English  class  that 
semester. 

We  slept  together  several 
times,  and  while  I  really 
didn’t  enjoy  the  actual  sex, 


the  sensation  of  closeness,  of 
connection,  felt  comforting  to 
me.  When  Jake  touched  me 
like  that,  I  knew  he  loved  me. 
I  knew  sex  was  a  beautiful, 
passionate  thing,  and  it  was 
right  to  be  with  him. 

Sleeping  with  Wesley 
Rush  was  entirely  different. 
While  I  definitely  got  more 
physical  pleasure  out  of  it,  the 
closeness  and  the  love  were 
missing.  When  it  was  over,  I 


felt  dirty.  I  felt  like  I’d  done 
something  wrong  and 
shameful,  but  at  the  same 
time,  I  felt  good.  Alive.  Free. 
Wild.  My  mind  was  totally 
cleared,  like  someone  had  hit 
the  refresh  button.  I  knew  the 
euphoria  wouldn’t  last 
forever,  but  the  filthy  regret 
was  worth  the  momentary 
escape. 

“Wow,”  Wesley  said.  We 
were  lying  in  his  bed  only  a 


few  minutes  after  we’d 
finished,  with  a  foot  or  more 
space  between  our  bodies.  “I 
definitely  wasn’t  expecting 
that.” 

God,  he  ruined  everything 
when  he  talked.  Annoyed, 
and  still  wading  through  the 
emotional  repercussions,  I 
sneered.  “What?  Ashamed 
that  you  screwed  the  Duff?” 

“No.”  I  was  surprised  by 
how  serious  he  sounded.  “I’m 


never  ashamed  of  anyone  I 
sleep  with.  Sex  is  a  natural 
chemical  reaction.  It  always 
happens  for  a  reason.  Who 
am  I  to  dictate  who 
experiences  the  joy  of  sharing 
my  bed?”  He  didn’t  see  me 
roll  my  eyes  as  he  continued. 
“No,  I  just  meant  that  I’m 
shocked.  I  was  honestly 
starting  to  believe  that  you 
hated  me.” 

“I  do  hate  you,”  I  assured 


him,  kicking  off  the  covers 
and  moving  to  pick  up  my 
clothes. 

“You  must  not  hate  me 
too  much,”  Wesley  said, 
rolling  onto  his  elbow  and 
watching  me  dress.  “You  did 
pretty  much  throw  yourself  at 
me.  Generally,  hatred  doesn’t 
inspire  that  kind  of  passion.” 

I  pulled  on  my  T-shirt. 
“Believe  me,  Wesley,  I 
definitely  hate  you.  I  was  just 


using  you.  You  use  people  all 
the  time,  so  I’m  sure  you 
understand.”  I  buttoned  my 
jeans  and  grabbed  my 
alligator  clip  from  the 
nightstand.  “This  was  fun,  but 
if  you  ever  tell  anyone,  I 
swear  I’ll  castrate  you. 

Clear?” 

“Why?”  he  asked.  “Your 
reputation  could  only 
improve  if  people  found  out 
you  slept  with  me.” 


“That  might  be  true,”  I 
admitted.  “But  I  have  no 
desire  to  improve  my 
reputation,  especially  not  that 
way.  So  are  you  going  to 
keep  your  mouth  shut  or  do  I 
need  to  find  a  sharp  object 
now?” 

“A  gentleman  doesn’t  kiss 
and  tell,”  he  said. 

“You’re  not  a  gentleman.” 
I  put  my  hair  back  up  in  the 
clip.  “That’s  why  I’m 


worried.”  I  glanced  at  my 
reflection  in  the  full-length 
mirror  on  the  wall.  Once  I 
was  sure  that  I  looked  normal 
— not  guilty — I  turned  to  face 
Wesley  again.  “Hurry  up  and 
put  your  pants  on.  We  need  to 
finish  this  stupid  essay.” 

It  was  a  little  after  seven  that 
night  when  Wesley  and  I 
finally  finished  the  essay  for 
English.  Or  at  least,  we 


finished  the  rough  copy.  I 
made  him  promise  that  he’d 
e-mail  me  the  draft  later  so 
that  I  could  edit  it. 

“You  don’t  trust  me  to  get 
it  done?”  he  asked,  raising  an 
eyebrow  at  me  as  I  put  my 
shoes  on  in  the  foyer. 

“I  don’t  trust  you  with 
anything,”  I  said. 

“Except  getting  you  off.” 
He  was  wearing  that  grin  I 
hated.  “So,  was  this  a  one- 


time  thing,  or  will  I  be  seeing 
you  again?” 

I  started  to  snort,  to  tell 
him  he  was  dreaming  if  he 
honestly  thought  I’d  be  back, 
but  then  I  remembered  that  I 
was  about  to  go  back  home. 
The  manila  envelope  would 
probably  still  be  lying  on  my 
kitchen  table. 

“Bianca?”  Wesley  asked. 
A  shiver  ran  across  my  skin 
when  he  touched  my 


shoulder.  “Are  you  all  right?” 

I  jerked  out  of  his  reach 
and  moved  toward  the  door. 
I’d  gotten  halfway  out  before 
I  turned  to  him  and  said,  with 
a  moment  of  hesitation, 
“We’ll  see.”  Then  I  ran  down 
the  front  steps. 

“Bianca,  wait.” 

I  clutched  my  jacket 
closer  to  me,  trying  to  fight 
the  cold  wind,  and  yanked 
open  the  door  of  my  Saturn. 


He  was  behind  me  in 
seconds,  but,  thankfully,  he 
didn’t  touch  me  this  time. 
“What?”  I  demanded  as  I  slid 
into  the  front  seat.  “I  need  to 
get  home.” 

Home,  the  last  place  I 
wanted  to  go. 

The  winter  sky  had 
already  turned  black,  but  I 
could  still  see  Wesley’s  gray 
eyes  in  the  darkness.  They 
were  exactly  the  color  of  the 


sky  before  a  thunderstorm. 

He  crouched  down  by  my 
door  to  get  to  my  eye  level, 
and  the  way  he  was  looking 
at  me  made  me  really 
uncomfortable.  “You  didn’t 
answer  the  other  question.” 

“What  other  question?” 

“Are  you  all  right?” 

I  scowled  at  him  for  a 
long  moment,  assuming  he 
was  just  trying  to  be  a  pain  in 
my  ass.  But  something  about 


his  lighted  eyes  made  me 
hesitate.  “It  doesn’t  matter  if  I 
am  or  not,”  I  whispered.  I 
started  my  car,  and  he  darted 
out  of  the  way  when  I  moved 
to  slam  the  door  shut.  “Bye, 
Wesley.” 

And  I  drove  away. 

When  I  got  home,  Dad 
was  still  in  his  bedroom.  I 
finished  cleaning  up  the 
living  room,  avoiding  the 
kitchen  altogether,  and  ran 


upstairs  to  take  a  shower.  The 
hot  water  didn’t  wash  away 
the  dirty  feeling  Wesley  had 
left  on  my  skin,  but  it  did 
relax  some  muscles  that  were 
forming  tense  knots  in  my 
back  and  shoulders.  I  just 
hoped  the  dirt  would  wash 
away  in  time. 

I’d  barely  wrapped  a 
towel  around  me  when  my 
cell  phone  started  ringing  in 
my  bedroom,  and  I  sprinted 


across  the  hall  to  answer  it  in 
time. 

“Hey,  B,”  Casey  said  into 
my  ear.  “So  are  you  and 
Wesley  done?” 

“What?” 

“You  two  were  working 
on  the  English  project  today, 
weren’t  you?”  she  asked.  “I 
thought  he  was  meeting  you 
at  your  place.” 

“Oh,...  right.  Well,  I 
wound  up  going  over  to  his 


house  instead.”  I  was  trying 
hard  not  to  sound  guilty. 

“OMG,  you  mean  the 
mansion?”  Casey  asked. 
“Lucky!  Did  you  walk  out 
onto  one  of  the  balconies? 
Vikki  said  that’s  half  the 
reason  she  wants  to  hook  up 
with  him  again.  Last  time,  it 
was  just  in  the  backseat  of  his 
Porsche,  but  she  really  wants 
to  see  the  inside  of  that 
house.” 


“Is  there  a  point  to  this 
conversation,  Casey?” 

“Oh,  yeah,”  she  laughed. 
“Sorry.  It’s  no  big  deal.  I  just 
wanted  to  make  sure  you 
were  all  right.” 

What  was  with  everyone 
asking  me  that  tonight? 

“I  know  you  hate  him,” 
she  continued.  “I  wanted  to 
make  sure  you  were  fine. . . 
and  that  he  was  okay,  too. 
You  didn’t,  like,  stab  the  boy, 


did  you?  I  mean,  I  totally 
disapprove  of  murdering 
hotties,  but  if  you  need  help 
burying  the  body,  you  know 
I’ll  bring  the  shovel.” 

“Thanks,  Casey,”  I  said. 
“But  he’s  alive.  Today  wasn’t 
as  bad  as  I  expected. 
Actually,. . .”  I  almost  told  her 
everything.  How  Mom  and 
Dad  were  getting  a  divorce 
and  how,  in  a  moment  of 
desperation,  I’d  kissed 


Wesley  Rush,  again.  How 
that  kiss  had  turned  into 
something  much,  much  more. 
How  my  body  felt  dirty  all 
over,  yet  at  the  same  time 
amazingly  free.  The  words 
lingered  on  the  tip  of  my 
tongue,  but  I  couldn’t  make 
them  come  out. 

Not  yet,  at  least. 

“Actually  what,  B?”  she 
asked,  bringing  me  out  of  my 
thoughts. 


“Um,...  nothing.  He 
actually  had  some  good  ideas 
for  the  paper.  That’s  it.  I 
guess  he’s,  like,  a  Hawthorne 
freak  or  something.” 

“Well,  that’s  good.  I  know 
you  find  smart  boys  sexy.  Are 
you  gonna  admit  you  want 
him  now?” 

I  froze,  not  knowing  how 
to  respond  to  this,  but  Casey 
was  laughing  already. 

“I’m  teasing,  but  I’m  glad 


things  turned  out  okay.  I  was 
a  little  worried  about  you 
today.  I  just  had  this  feeling 
that  something  bad  was  going 
to  happen.  I  guess  I  was  just 
being  paranoid.” 

“Probably.” 

“I’ve  got  to  go.  Jessica 
wants  me  to  call  her  with  all 
the  details  of  my  meeting 
with  Harrison.  She  just 
doesn’t  get  it,  does  she? 
Anyway,  I’ll  see  you  at 


school  on  Monday.” 

“Okay.  Bye,  Casey.” 

“See  you  later,  B.” 

I  flipped  the  cell  phone 
shut  and  placed  it  on  my 
nightstand,  feeling  like  a  total 
liar.  Technically,  I  hadn’t 
lied;  I’d  only  withheld,  but 
still. . .  withholding  from 
Casey  was,  like,  a  mortal  sin. 
Especially  when  she  made 
such  a  point  of  opening 
herself  to  my  problems. 


But  I’d  tell  her  eventually. 
Well,  about  my  parents,  at 
least.  I  just  needed  to  deal 
with  it  myself  before  I  sprang 
it  on  her  and  Jessica.  The 
Wesley  thing,  though. . .  God, 
I  hoped  they’d  never  find  out. 

I  knelt  at  the  foot  of  my 
bed  and  started  folding  the 
clean  clothes,  like  I  did  every 
night.  Weirdly,  I  wasn’t  as 
stressed  as  I’d  expected 
myself  to  be.  I  hated  to  admit 


it,  but  I  definitely  had  Wesley 
to  thank  for  that. 


9 


Dad  didn’t  leave  his  bedroom 
for  the  rest  of  the  weekend.  I 
knocked  a  couple  of  times 
Sunday  afternoon  and  offered 
to  make  him  something  to 
eat,  but  he  just  murmured  a 
refusal,  never  opening  the 
door  between  us.  His 


isolation  terrified  me.  He 
must  have  been  depressed 
about  Mom,  and  ashamed 
he’d  fallen  off  the  wagon  to 
top  it  off,  but  I  knew  this 
wasn’t  healthy.  I  decided  that 
if  he  hadn’t  emerged  by 
Monday  afternoon,  I  would 
bust  into  the  room  and. . . 
well,  I  didn’t  know  what  I’d 
do  next.  In  the  meantime,  I 
just  tried  not  to  think  of  my 
father  or  the  divorce  papers 


on  the  kitchen  table. 

Surprisingly,  that  was 
pretty  easy. 

Most  of  my  thoughts 
swarmed  around  Wesley.  Ew, 
right?  But  I  really  didn’t 
know  how  to  handle  school 
on  Monday.  What  did  one  do 
after  having  a  one-night  stand 
(or,  in  my  case,  one-afternoon 
stand)  with  the  school’s 
biggest  man- whore?  Was  I 
supposed  to  act  nonchalant? 


Treat  him  with  my  normal 
undisguised  hatred?  Or, 
because  I’d  honestly  enjoyed 
myself,  should  I  act,  like, 
grateful?  Tone  down  the 
contempt  and  be  friendly? 

Did  I  owe  him  something? 
Surely  not.  He’d  gotten  just 
as  much  out  of  the  experience 
as  I  had,  minus  the  self- 
loathing. 

By  the  time  I  arrived  at 
school  Monday  morning,  I’d 


pretty  much  settled  on 
avoiding  him  entirely. 

“Are  you  okay,  Bianca?” 
Jessica  asked  as  we  walked 
out  of  Spanish  at  the  end  of 
first  block.  “You’re  acting. . . 
um,  weird” 

I’ll  admit,  my  spy  skills 
weren’t  exactly  smooth,  but  I 
knew  that  Wesley  walked 
past  the  classroom  on  his  way 
to  second  block,  and  I  didn’t 
want  to  risk  an  awkward  post- 


sex  meeting  in  the  hallway.  I 
peered  anxiously  around  the 
edge  of  the  door,  scanning  the 
crowd  for  those  unmistakable 
brown  curls.  But  if  Jessica 
could  tell  something  was  up,  I 
was  being  way  too  obvious. 

“It’s  nothing,”  I  lied, 
stepping  out  into  the  hall.  I 
looked  both  ways,  like  a 
small  child  crossing  a  busy 
highway,  and  I  was  relieved 
that  I  didn’t  see  him 


anywhere.  “I’m  fine.” 

“Oh,  okay,”  she  said 
without  suspicion.  “I  must  be 
imagining  it,  then.” 

“You  must  be.” 

Jessica  tugged  at  a  loose 
strand  of  her  blond  hair  that 
had  escaped  from  the 
confines  of  her  ponytail.  “Oh, 
Bianca,  I  forgot  to  tell  you! 
I’m  so  excited!” 

“Let  me  guess,”  I  teased. 
“This  has  something  to  do 


with  Harrison  Carlyle,  right? 
Did  he  ask  you  where  you  got 
your  cute  skinny  jeans  this 
time?  Or  how  you  condition 
your  luscious  hair?” 

“No!”  Jessica  giggled. 
“No. . . .  Actually,  it’s  my 
brother.  He’s  coming  to  visit 
us  for  the  week,  and  he 
should  be  getting  into 
Hamilton  by  noon  today. 

He’s  going  to  pick  me  up 
from  school  this  afternoon. 


I’m  really  excited  to  see  him. 
It’s  been,  like,  two  and  a  half 
years  since  he  left  for  college 
and  — .  Hey,  Bianca,  are  you 
sure  you’re  okay?” 

I  stood  frozen  in  the 
middle  of  the  hallway.  I  could 
feel  the  blood  draining  from 
my  face,  and  my  hands  turned 
cold  and  started  to  shake. 
There  was  definite  nausea 
coming  on,  but  I  told  the 
same  old  lie.  “I’m  fine.”  I 


forced  my  feet  to  move  again. 
“I  just,  um,  thought  I  forgot 
something.  It’s  fine.  Now, 
what  were  you  saying?” 

Jessica  nodded.  “Oh,  well, 
I’m  so  excited  about  Jake!  I 
can’t  believe  I’m  saying  this, 
but  I’ve  really,  really  missed 
him.  It’ll  be  nice  to  hang  out 
with  him  for  a  few  days.  Oh, 
and  I  think  Tiffany  is  coming 
with  him.  Did  I  tell  you  they 
just  got  engaged?” 


“No.  That’s  great....  I’ve 
gotta  get  to  class,  Jessica.” 

“Oh,...  okay.  Well,  I’ll 
see  you  in  English,  Bianca.”  I 
was  halfway  down  the 
hallway  before  Jessica  got  the 
sentence  out  of  her  mouth. 

I  pushed  past  the 
stampeding  students,  barely 
hearing  them  as  they  bitched 
at  me  for  stepping  on  their 
toes  or  ramming  them  with 
my  backpack.  The  sounds 


around  me  slowly  faded  as 
unwanted  memories  flooded 
into  my  head.  It  was  like 
Jessica’s  words  had  broken 
the  dam  that  held  them  back 
for  so  long. 

“ So ,  you ' re  Bianca?  The 
freshman  bitch  that ’s  been 
screwing  my  boyfriend?  ” 

“ Your  boyfriend?  I 
haven ’t  been —  ” 

“Stay  the  hell  away  from 
Jake.  ” 


My  face  burned  as  the 
memories  rushed  back.  My 
feet  moved  so  fast  I  was 
almost  sprinting  toward  my 
AP  government  class.  As  if  I 
could  outrun  the  thoughts.  As 
if  they  wouldn’t  chase  me 
with  a  vengeance.  But  Jake 
Gaither  would  be  back  in 
Hamilton  for  a  week.  Jake 
Gaither  was  engaged  to 
Tiffany.  Jake  Gaither...  the 
boy  who  broke  my  heart. 


I  ran  into  the  classroom 
just  as  the  tardy  bell  rang.  I 
knew  Mr.  Chaucer’s  eyes 
were  glaring  in  my  direction, 
but  I  didn’t  bother  to  look.  I 
took  my  seat  near  the  back  of 
the  room,  trying  desperately 
to  focus  on  something  else. 

But  not  even  Toby 
Tucker’s  witty  commentary 
on  the  legislative  branch  or 
the  back  of  his  adorable  out- 
of- fashion  head  could  tempt 


my  thoughts  away  from  Jake 
and  his  bride  to  be. 

I  barely  heard  a  word  Mr. 
Chaucer  said  all  block,  and 
when  the  bell  rang,  my  page 
of  notes,  which  should  have 
been  full  of  details  from  the 
lecture,  consisted  of  only  two 
short,  barely  legible 
sentences.  God,  I  was  going 
to  fail  this  class  if  shit  like 
this  kept  coming  up. 

So  much  drama!  If  I  were 


a  rich  Manhattan  snob,  I 
could  have  been  a  character 
on  Gossip  Girl.  (Not  that  I 
watch  that  trashy  show. . . 
often. . .  that  my  friends  know 
about. . .  )  Why  couldn’t  my 
life  be  a  sitcom?  Then  again, 
even  the  Friends  crowd  had 
issues. 

I  slouched  toward  the 
cafeteria,  and  I  found  Casey 
and  Jessica  waiting  for  me  at 
our  table.  As  always,  Angela, 


Jeanine,  and  Jeanine’s  cousin 
Vikki  joined  us.  Angela  was 
busy  showing  everyone  her 
new  Vans,  so  my  sulkiness 
went  unnoticed  as  I  slumped 
into  my  chair. 

“Cute,”  Casey 
commented,  grinning  at  the 
shoes.  “Who  got  them  for 
you?” 

“Daddy,”  Angela 
answered,  stroking  the  toe  of 
her  purple  shoe.  “He  and 


Mom  are  competing  for  my 
love  now.  At  first  it  was  kind 
of  annoying,  but  I’ve  decided 
to  take  the  high  road  and  have 
fun  with  it.”  She  crossed  her 
legs  and  tossed  back  her  dark 
hair.  “I’m  hoping  for  Prada 
next.” 

Everyone  laughed. 

“I  didn’t  get  anything  cool 
out  of  my  parents’  divorce,” 
Casey  said.  “My  dad  didn’t 
really  care  if  I  loved  him 


more,  I  guess.” 

“That’s  sad,  Case,”  Jessica 
murmured. 

“Oh,  not  really.”  Casey 
shrugged  and  started  picking 
at  her  orange  fingernail 
polish.  “Dad’s  an  ass.  I  was 
thrilled  when  Mom  kicked 
him  out  of  the  house.  She 
cries  a  lot  less  now,  and  when 
Mom’s  happier,  the  world  is 
happier.  Sure,  we  don’t  have 
as  much  money  anymore,  but 


it  wasn’t  like  Dad  spent  his 
checks  on  us,  anyway.  He 
offered  to  buy  Mom  a  car  she 
didn’t  want,  but  that’s  about 
the  extent  of  his  good 
nature.” 

“Divorces  are  depressing,” 
Jessica  sighed.  “I’d  be 
heartbroken  if  my  parents 
split  up.  Wouldn’t  you, 
Bianca?” 

I  felt  heat  rush  to  my  face, 
but  Casey  was  switching  the 


subject,  so  I  pretended  I 
hadn’t  heard  Jessica’s 
question.  “Hey,  Vikki,  what 
happened  on  Homecoming 
night?  You  never  told  us  how 
that  went  down.” 

Jeanine  giggled 
knowingly.  “You  haven’t  told 
them  yet,  Vikki?” 

Vikki  rolled  her  eyes  and 
twirled  a  strand  of  her  curly 
strawberry-blond  hair  around 
her  perfectly  manicured 


finger.  “Oh  my  God.  Okay, 
so  Clint  is  totally  not 
speaking  to  me  anymore,  and 
Ross...” 

Her  voice  drifted  into  the 
background  and  my  mind 
wandered.  As  much  as  I 
wanted  to  stop  thinking  of 
Jake,  I  couldn’t  bring  myself 
to  be  interested  in  Vikki’s 
boy  troubles.  On  any  other 
day,  I  would  have  found  mild 
amusement  in  her  story,  like 


she  was  my  own  personal 
soap  opera,  but  at  that 
moment  her  drama  seemed  so 
vague  and  unimportant.  So 
vapid.  So  indulgent.  So 
empty. 

I  couldn’t  help  feeling  a 
little  guilty  for  thinking  this. 
That  made  me  just  as  self- 
absorbed  as  she  was.  So  I 
halfheartedly  tried  to  listen  to 
the  woes  of  Vikki  McPhee. 

Then  something  she  said 


caught  my  full  attention. 

“. . .  but  I  did  fool  around 
with  Wesley  for  a  little  while 
afterward.” 

“Wesley?”  I  said. 

Vikki  beamed  at  me, 
proud  of  what  she  viewed  as 
an  achievement.  Didn’t  she 
know  more  than  two-thirds  of 
the  girls  in  school  had 
accomplished  the  same  thing? 
Including  me. . .  but,  of 
course,  she  didn’t  know  that 


part.  “Yeah,”  she  said.  “After 
the  fight  with  Clint,  I  wound 
up  out  in  the  parking  lot  with 
Wesley.  We  messed  around 
in  his  car  for  a  while,  but  my 
mom  called,  so  I  had  to  get 
home  before  we  could  do 
anything.  Sucks,  right?” 

“Sure.” 

My  eyes  moved  across  the 
cafeteria,  searching  for  a  few 
seconds  before  they  located 
the  back  of  a  curly  brown 


head  inches  above  those 
around  him.  He  sat  with  a 
group  of  friends — mostly 
girls,  naturally — at  a  long 
rectangular  table  on  the  other 
side  of  the  room.  He  was 
wearing  a  tight  black  T-shirt 
that,  while  not  really 
appropriate  for  the  frigid 
temperatures  of  early 
February,  showed  off  his 
perfect  muscular  arms.  Arms 
that  had  twined  around  me. . . 


arms  that  had  helped  erase 
my  stress... 

“Did  I  tell  you  guys  that 
my  brother  is  coming  to 
town?”  Jessica  asked.  “He 
and  his  fiancee  are  visiting 
for  the  week.” 

Casey’s  worried  eyes 
immediately  turned  on  me 
and  widened  when  she 
realized  I  was  on  my  feet. 
“Where  are  you  going,  B?” 

Everyone  at  the  table 


looked  at  me  then,  and  I  tried 
to  sound  convincing.  “I  just 
remembered,”  I  said.  “I  need 
to  go  talk  to  Wesley  about 
our  English  project.”  Screw 
avoiding  him.  I  had  a  better, 
more  helpful  idea. 

“Didn’t  you  finish  that  on 
Saturday?”  Jessica  asked. 

“We  got  started  on  it,  but 
we  didn’t  finish  the  paper.” 

“  ’Cause  you  were  too 
busy  making  out,”  Casey 


teased,  winking  at  me. 

Don ’t  look  guilty.  Don ’t 
look  guilty. 

“Making  out?”  Vikki 
raised  an  eyebrow  at  me. 

“Didn’t  you  hear?”  Jessica 
laughed,  smiling  good- 
naturedly  at  me.  “Bianca  is 
madly  in  love  with  Wesley.” 

I  faked  a  gagging  noise 
and  everyone  laughed.  “Yeah, 
right,”  I  said,  making  sure 
that  my  voice  was  full  of 


irritation  and  disgust.  “I  can’t 
stand  him.  God,  I’ve  lost  so 
much  respect  for  Mrs.  Perkins 
since  she  made  me  work  with 
him.” 

“I’d  be  ecstatic  if  I  were 
you,”  Vikki  said,  sounding  a 
little  bitter. 

Jeanine  and  Angela 
nodded  in  agreement. 

“Anyway.”  I  was  feeling  a 
little  jumpy.  “I  need  to  talk  to 
him  about  getting  this  done. 


I’ll  see  you  all  later,  okay?” 

“  ’kay,”  Jessica  said, 
waving  cheerfully. 

I  hurried  through  the 
crowded  cafeteria,  not 
slowing  down  until  I  was 
within  five  feet  of  Wesley’s 
table,  where  the  only  other 
male  occupant  was  Harrison 
Carlyle.  Then  I  paused  for  a 
second,  suddenly  a  little 
hesitant. 

One  of  the  girls,  a  skinny 


blonde  with  Angelina  Jolie 
lips,  was  rattling  on  about  her 
crappy  vacation  in  Miami, 
and  Wesley  was  listening 
with  rapt  attention — 
obviously  trying  to  convince 
her  of  his  sympathy.  Disgust 
erased  my  insecurity,  and  I 
cleared  my  throat  loudly, 
getting  the  whole  group’s 
attention. 

The  blonde  was  agitated 
and  angry,  but  I  focused  on 


Wesley,  who  looked  at  me 
casually,  like  he  would  any 
other  girl.  I  turned  up  my 
nose  and  said,  “I  need  to  talk 
to  you  about  our  English 
paper.” 

“Is  it  necessary?”  Wesley 
asked  with  a  sigh. 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “Right 
now.  I’m  not  going  to  fail  this 
stupid  assignment  because  of 
your  lazy  ass.” 

He  rolled  his  eyes  and  got 


to  his  feet.  “Sorry,  ladies,”  he 
said  to  the  tragedy- stricken 
girls.  “I’ll  see  you  tomorrow. 
You’ll  save  a  seat  for  me?” 

“Of  course  we  will,”  a 
tiny  redhead  squeaked. 

As  Wesley  and  I  walked 
away,  I  heard  Big  Lips  hiss, 
“God,  that  girl  is  a  bitch /” 
When  we  were  out  in  the 
hallway  Wesley  asked, 
“What’s  the  problem,  Duffy? 
I  e-mailed  you  the  essay  last 


night,  just  like  you 
demanded.  And  where 
exactly  are  we  going?  The 
library?” 

“Just  shut  up  and  come 
with  me.”  I  led  him  down  the 
hall  past  the  English 
classrooms. 

Don’t  ask  where  I  got  this 
idea,  because  I  couldn’t  tell 
you,  but  I  knew  precisely 
where  we  were  going,  and  I 
was  sure  that  this  might 


officially  make  me  a  slut.  But 
when  we  reached  the  door  of 
the  unused  janitor’s  closet,  I 
had  no  feeling  of  shame. . . 
not  yet,  at  least. 

I  grasped  the  doorknob 
and  noticed  Wesley’s  eyes 
narrow  with  suspicion.  I 
yanked  open  the  door, 
checked  that  no  one  was 
watching,  and  gestured  for 
him  to  go  inside.  Wesley 
walked  into  the  tiny  closet, 


and  I  followed,  shutting  the 
door  stealthily  behind  us. 

“Something  tells  me  this 
isn’t  about  The  Scarlet 
Letter •”  he  said,  and  even  in 
the  dark  I  knew  he  was 
grinning. 

“Be  quiet.” 

This  time  he  met  me 
halfway.  His  hands  tangled  in 
my  hair  and  mine  clawed  at 
his  forearms.  We  kissed 
violently,  and  my  back 


slammed  against  the  wall.  I 
heard  a  mop — or  maybe  a 
broom — topple  over,  but  my 
brain  barely  registered  the 
sound  as  one  of  Wesley’s 
hands  moved  to  my  hip, 
holding  me  closer  to  him.  He 
was  so  much  taller  than  me 
that  I  had  to  tilt  my  head  back 
almost  all  the  way  to  meet  his 
kiss.  His  lips  pressed  hard 
against  mine,  and  I  let  my 
hands  explore  his  biceps. 


The  smell  of  his  cologne, 
rather  than  the  lonely,  stale 
air  of  the  closet,  filled  my 
senses. 

We  wrestled  in  the 
darkness  for  a  while  before  I 
felt  his  hand  insistently  lifting 
the  hem  of  my  T-shirt.  With  a 
gasp,  I  pulled  away  from  the 
kiss  and  grabbed  his  wrist. 
“No...  not  now.” 

“Then  when?”  Wesley 
asked  in  my  ear,  still  pinning 


me  to  the  wall.  He  didn’t 
even  sound  winded. 

I,  on  the  other  hand, 
struggled  to  catch  my  breath. 
“Later.” 

“Be  more  specific.” 

I  squirmed  out  of  his  arms 
and  moved  toward  the  door, 
nearly  tripping  over  what  felt 
like  a  bucket.  I  raised  a  hand 
to  flatten  my  wavy  hair  and 
reached  for  the  doorknob. 
“Tonight.  I’ll  be  at  your 


house  around  seven.  Okay?” 
But  before  he  could  answer,  I 
slipped  out  of  the  closet  and 
hurried  down  the  hall,  hoping 
it  didn’t  look  like  a  walk  of 
shame. 


10 


I  didn’t  think  the  final  bell 
would  ever  ring.  Calculus 
was  excruciatingly  long  and 
boring,  and  English  was 
nerve-racking.  I  caught 
myself  glancing  across  the 
room  at  Wesley  several  times, 
anxious  to  feel  the  mind- 


numbing  effects  of  his  arms, 
hands,  and  lips  again. 

I  just  prayed  my  friends 
didn’t  notice.  Jessica,  of 
course,  would  believe  me  if  I 
told  her  she  was  imagining 
things;  Casey,  on  the  other 
hand. . .  well,  hopefully  Casey 
was  too  absorbed  in  Mrs. 
Perkins’s  grammar  lesson — 
ha,  yeah  right! — to  look  over 
at  me.  She  would  probably 
interrogate  me  for  hours  and 


guess  everything  that  had 
happened,  seeing  right 
through  my  denials.  I  really 
needed  to  get  the  hell  out  of 
there  before  I  was  exposed. 

But  when  the  bell  finally 
rang,  I  was  in  no  hurry  to 
walk  outside. 

Jessica  skipped  toward  the 
cafeteria  with  her  blond 
ponytail  bouncing  behind  her. 
“I  can’t  wait  to  see  him!” 

“We  get  it,  Jess,”  Casey 


said.  “Y ou  love  your  big 
brother.  It’s  cute,  really,  but 
you’ve  said  that. . .  twenty 
times  today?  Thirty,  maybe?” 

Jessica  blushed.  “Well,  I 
can’t  wait.” 

“Of  course  you  can’t.” 
Casey  smiled  at  her.  “I’m 
sure  he’ll  be  happy  to  see 
you,  too,  but  you  might  want 
to  calm  down  just  a  tiny  bit.” 
She  stopped  in  the  middle  of 
the  cafeteria  and  looked  over 


her  shoulder  at  me.  “You 
coming,  B?” 

“No,”  I  said,  crouching 
down  and  messing  with  my 
shoestrings.  “I  need  to. . .  tie 
this.  You  guys  go  ahead. 
Don’t  stall  the  reunion  for 
me.” 

Casey  gave  me  a  knowing 
look  before  nodding  and 
pushing  Jessica  ahead.  She 
started  a  new  conversation  to 
distract  Jessica  from  my  lame 


excuse.  “So  tell  me  about  this 
fiancee.  What’s  she  like? 
Pretty?  Dumb  as  a  sack  of 
potatoes?  I  want  the  details.” 

I  waited  in  the  cafeteria 
for  a  good  twenty  minutes, 
not  wanting  to  chance  seeing 
him  in  the  parking  lot.  How 
funny  that,  less  than  seven 
hours  earlier,  I’d  been 
avoiding  a  completely 
different  guy. . .  one  I  was 
now  desperate  to  see.  As  sick 


and  twisted  as  it  was,  I 
couldn’t  wait  to  be  back  in 
Wesley’s  bedroom.  Back  on 
my  own  private  island 
getaway.  Back  in  my  world 
of  escape.  But  first  I  had  to 
wait  until  Jake  Gaither  drove 
out  of  the  parking  lot. 

When  I  felt  confident  that 
he’d  gone,  I  walked  out  of  the 
school,  pulling  my  coat  tight 
around  me.  The  February 
wind  bit  at  my  face  as  I 


moved  across  the  empty 
parking  lot,  and  the  sight  of 
my  heat-challenged  car  didn’t 
hold  any  comfort.  I  slid  into 
the  driver’s  seat,  shivering 
like  crazy,  and  started  the 
engine.  The  ride  home 
seemed  to  take  hours  even 
though  Hamilton  High  was 
only  about  four  miles  from 
my  house. 

I’d  just  started  to  wonder 
if  I  could  go  to  Wesley’s 


house  a  few  hours  early  when 
I  pulled  into  my  driveway  and 
remembered  my  dad.  Oh, 
great.  His  car  was  in  the 
driveway,  but  he  shouldn’t 
have  been  home  from  work 
yet. 

“Damn  it!”  I  wailed, 
punching  the  steering  wheel 
and  jumping  like  an  idiot 
when  the  horn  sounded. 
“Damn  it!  Damn  it!” 

Guilt  surged  through  me. 


How  could  I  forget  about 
Dad?  Poor,  lonely, 
barricaded-in-his-bedroom 
Dad?  I  worried  as  I  climbed 
out  of  the  car  and  trudged  up 
the  sidewalk  that  he  might 
still  be  in  his  room.  If  he  was, 
would  I  have  to  break  down 
the  door?  Then  what?  Yell  at 
him?  Cry  with  him?  Tell  him 
that  Mom  didn’t  deserve 
him?  What  was  the  right 
answer? 


But  Dad  was  sitting  on  the 
couch  when  I  walked  inside, 
a  bowl  of  popcorn  in  his  lap.  I 
hesitated  in  the  doorway,  not 
sure  what  the  hell  was  going 
on.  He  looked. . .  normal.  He 
didn’t  look  like  he’d  been 
crying  or  drinking  or 
anything.  He  just  looked  like 
my  dad  with  his  thick- 
rimmed  glasses  and  untidy 
auburn  hair.  The  same  way  I 
saw  him  every  other  day  of 


the  week. 

“Hey,  Bumblebee,”  he 
said,  looking  up  at  me.  “Want 
some  popcorn?  There’s  a 
Clint  Eastwood  movie  on 
AMC.” 

“Um. . .  no  thanks.”  I 
looked  around  the  room.  No 
broken  glass.  No  beer  bottles. 
Like  he  hadn’t  been  drinking 
that  day  at  all.  I  wondered  if 
that  was  it.  If  the  relapse  was 
over.  Did  relapses  work  that 


way?  I  had  no  clue.  But  I 
couldn’t  help  feeling  wary. 
“Dad,  are  you  okay?” 

“Oh,  I’m  fine,”  he  said.  “I 
woke  up  late  this  morning,  so 
I  just  called  work  and  told 
them  I  was  sick.  I  haven’t 
taken  any  of  my  vacation 
days,  so  it’s  not  a  big  deal.” 

I  glanced  into  the  kitchen. 
The  manila  envelope  still  sat 
on  the  kitchen  table. 
Untouched. 


He  must  have  followed 
my  gaze,  or  guessed,  because 
he  said  with  a  shrug,  “Oh, 
those  stupid  papers!  You 
know,  they  had  me  in  such  a 
fit.  I  finally  thought  about  it 
and  realized  that  they’re  just  a 
mistake.  Your  mom’s  lawyer 
heard  she’d  been  gone  a  little 
longer  than  usual  this  time 
and  jumped  the  gun.” 

“Have  you  talked  to  her?” 

“No,”  Dad  admitted.  “But 


I’m  sure  that’s  the  problem.  It 
must  be.  Nothing  to  worry 
about,  Bumblebee.  How  was 
your  day?” 

“It  was  good.” 

We  were  both  lying,  but  / 
knew  that  my  words  weren’t 
true.  He,  on  the  other  hand, 
seemed  genuinely  convinced. 
How  could  I  remind  him  that 
Mom’s  signature  was  on  the 
papers?  How  could  I  bring 
him  back  to  reality?  That 


would  only  drive  him  into  his 
bedroom  again — or  send  him 
in  search  of  a  bottle — and 
min  this  moment  of 
manufactured  peace. 

And  I  didn’t  want  to  be 
the  one  to  fuck  up  my  dad’s 
sobriety. 

Shock,  I  decided  as  I 
walked  up  the  stairs  to  my 
bedroom.  He  was  simply  in 
shock.  But  the  denial 
wouldn’t  last  long. 


Eventually  he’d  wake  up.  I 
just  hoped  he’d  do  it  with 
grace. 

I  stretched  out  on  my  bed 
with  my  calculus  book  in 
front  of  me,  trying  to  do 
homework  I  really  didn’t 
understand.  My  eyes  kept 
jumping  to  the  alarm  clock  on 
my  nightstand.  3:28...  3:31... 
3:37 ...  Minutes  ticked  by, 
and  math  problems  blurred 
into  patterns  of  unidentifiable 


symbols,  like  ancient  runes. 
Finally  I  slammed  the  book 
shut  and  conceded  defeat. 

This  was  sick.  I  should  not 
have  been  thinking  of 
Wesley.  I  shouldn’t  have 
been  kissing  Wesley.  I 
shouldn’t  have  been  sleeping 
with  Wesley.  Hell,  barely  a 
week  earlier  I  would  have 
thought  speaking  to  him  was 
horrific.  But  the  more  my 
world  spun,  the  more 


appealing  he  became.  Don’t 
get  me  wrong,  I  still  hated 
him  with  a  passion.  His 
arrogance  made  me  want  to 
scream,  but  his  ability  to  free 
me — if  only  temporarily — 
from  my  problems  left  me 
high.  He  was  my  drug. 
Seriously  sick. 

Even  more  sick  was  the 
way  I  lied  to  Casey  about  it 
when  she  called  at  five-thirty. 

“Hey,  are  you  okay?  Oh 


my  God,  I  can’t  believe 
Jake’s  back.  Are  you,  like, 
flipping  out?  Do  you  need  me 
to  come  over?” 

“No.”  I  was  feeling 
jumpy,  still  glancing  at  the 
clock  every  few  minutes. 

“I’m  fine.” 

“Don’t  bottle  it  up,  B,” 
she  urged. 

“I’m  not.  I’m  fine.” 

“I’m  coming  over,”  she 
said. 


“No,”  I  said  quickly. 
“Don’t.  There’s  no  reason 
to.” 

There  was  silence  for  a 
second,  and  when  Casey 
spoke  again,  she  sounded 
kind  of  hurt.  “Okay. . .  but,  I 
mean,  even  if  we  didn’t  talk 
about  Jake,  we  could  just 
hang  out  or  whatever.” 

“I  can’t,”  I  said.  “I,  um. . .” 
It  was  five-thirty- three.  Still 
an  hour  before  I  could  leave 


for  Wesley’s.  But  I  couldn’t 
tell  Casey  that.  Never.  “I’m 
thinking  I  might  go  to  bed 
early  tonight.” 

“What?” 

“I  stayed  up  way  too  late 
last  night  watching,  um. . .  a 
movie.  I’m  exhausted.” 

She  knew  I  was  lying.  It 
was  pretty  obvious.  But  she 
didn’t  question  me.  Instead, 
she  just  said,  “Well. . .  fine,  I 
guess.  But  maybe  tomorrow? 


Or  this  weekend?  You  really 
do  need  to  talk  about  it,  B. 
Even  if  you  don’t  think  you 
need  to.  Just  because  he’s 
Jessica’s  brother...” 

At  least  she  thought  I  was 
lying  to  cover  up  my  issues 
with  Jake.  I’d  rather  she  think 
that  than  know  the  truth. 

God,  I  was  such  a  shitty 
friend.  But  Wesley  was  just 
something  I  had  to  lie  about. 
To  everyone. 


When  six-forty-five 
finally  rolled  around,  I 
grabbed  my  coat  and  raced 
downstairs,  already  pulling 
my  car  keys  out  of  my 
pocket.  I  found  Dad  in  the 
kitchen,  microwaving  some 
Pizza  Rolls.  He  smiled  at  me 
as  I  put  on  my  gloves.  “Hey, 
Dad,”  I  said.  “I’ll  be  back 
later.” 

“Where  are  you  going, 
Bumblebee?” 


Oh,  uh,  good  question. 

This  was  a  problem  I  hadn’t 
anticipated,  but  when  all  else 
fails,  tell  the  truth. . .  or  part  of 
it  at  least. 

“I’m  going  to  Wesley 
Rush’s  house.  We’re  working 
on  a  paper  for  English  class.  I 
won’t  be  home  late  or 
anything.”  Oh,  please,  I 
thought.  Please  don ’t  let  my 
cheeks  turn  red. 

“Okay,”  Dad  said.  “Have 


fun  with  Wesley.” 

I  ran  out  of  the  kitchen 
before  my  face  could  burst 
into  flames. 

“Bye,  Dad!” 

I  practically  sprinted  out 
to  my  car,  and  I  tried  very, 
very  hard  not  to  speed  when  I 
pulled  onto  the  highway.  I 
was  not  getting  my  first  ticket 
because  of  Wesley  Rush.  The 
line  had  to  be  drawn 
somewhere. 


Then  again,  I’d  crossed 
several  lines  already. 

But  what  exactly  was  I 
doing?  I’d  always  mocked 
girls  who  screwed  Wesley, 
and  yet,  here  I  was,  becoming 
one  of  them.  I  told  myself 
there  was  a  difference.  Those 
girls  thought  they  had  a  shot 
with  Wesley;  they  found  him 
sexy  and  appealing — which, 
in  a  twisted  way,  I  guess  he 
was.  They  believed  he  was  a 


good  guy  they  could  tame, 
but  I  knew  he  was  a  jackass.  I 
only  wanted  his  body.  No 
strings.  No  feelings.  I  only 
wanted  the  high. 

Did  that  make  me  a  junkie 
and  a  slut? 

My  car  came  to  a  stop  in 
front  of  the  gigantic  house, 
and  I  decided  that  my  actions 
were  excusable.  People  with 
cancer  smoke  pot  for 
medicinal  purposes;  my 


situation  was  very  similar.  If  I 
didn’t  use  Wesley  to  distract 
me,  I  would  go  crazy,  so  I 
was  really  saving  myself 
from  self-destruction  and  a 
load  of  therapy  bills. 

I  walked  up  the  sidewalk 
and  rang  the  doorbell.  A 
second  later,  the  lock  clicked 
and  the  knob  turned.  The 
instant  Wesley’s  grinning 
face  appeared  in  the  doorway, 
I  knew  that,  regardless  of  my 


reasoning,  this  entire  thing 
was  wrong.  Disgusting.  Sick. 
Unhealthy. 

And  completely 
exhilarating. 


11 


I  had  major  sex  hair.  I  stared 
into  the  big  mirror  and  tried 
to  flatten  the  mess  of  auburn 
waves  while  Wesley  put  his 
clothes  on  behind  me. 
Definitely  not  a  situation  I’d 
ever  imagined  myself  in. 

“I’m  perfectly  fine  with 


being  used,”  he  said  as  he 
pulled  on  the  tight  black  T- 
shirt.  His  hair  was  pretty 
incriminating,  too.  “But  I 
would  like  to  know  for  what 
I’m  being  used.” 

“Distraction.” 

“That  much  I  gathered.” 
The  mattress  creaked  when 
he  flopped  down  onto  his 
back  and  tucked  his  arms 
behind  his  head.  “What  am  I 
supposed  to  be  distracting 


you  from?  There’s  a  chance 
that,  if  I  know,  I  could  do  my 
job  more  efficiently.” 

“You’re  doing  just  fine 
already.”  I  scraped  my 
fingernails  through  my  hair, 
but  it  was  as  good  as  it  would 
get.  Sighing,  I  turned  away 
from  the  mirror  and  faced 
Wesley.  To  my  surprise,  he 
was  watching  me  with  actual 
interest.  “Do  you  really 
care?” 


“Sure.”  He  sat  up  and 
patted  a  spot  beside  him. 
“There’s  more  to  this 
amazing  body  than  awe¬ 
inspiring  abs.  I  have  a  pair  of 
ears,  too,  and  they  happen  to 
work  superbly.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes  and  sat 
next  to  him,  pulling  my  feet 
up  onto  the  bed.  “Okay,”  I 
said,  wrapping  my  arms 
around  my  knees.  “Not  that  it 
matters,  but  I  found  out  that 


my  ex-boyfriend  is  coming 
back  to  town  for  a  week  this 
morning.  It’s  so  stupid,  but  I 
panicked.  I  mean,  the  last 
time  we  saw  each  other. . .  it 
didn’t  go  very  well.  That’s 
why  I  dragged  you  into  the 
closet  at  school.” 

“What  happened?” 

“You  were  there.  Don’t 
make  me  relive  it.” 

“I  meant  with  your  ex- 
boyfriend,”  Wesley  said.  “I’m 


curious.  What  kind  of  misery 
could  cause  a  hateful  person 
like  you  to  run  into  my 
muscular  arms?  Or  is  he  the 
one  who  put  that  layer  of  ice 
around  your  heart?”  His 
words  sounded  facetious,  but 
his  smile  seemed  sincere,  not 
the  lopsided  one  he  wore 
when  he  thought  he  was 
being  clever. 

“We  started  dating  during 
my  freshman  year,”  I  began 


reluctantly.  “He  was  a  senior, 
and  I  knew  that  my  parents 
would  never  let  me  see  him  if 
they  knew  how  old  he  was. 

So  we  kept  the  whole  thing  a 
secret  from  everyone.  He 
never  introduced  me  to  his 
friends  or  took  me  places  or 
talked  to  me  at  school,  and  I 
just  assumed  it  was  to  protect 
us.  Well,  of  course,  I  was 
totally  wrong.” 

My  skin  itched  as 


Wesley’s  eyes  steadied  on 
me.  God,  that  annoyed  me. 

He  was  probably  looking  at 
me  with  pity.  Poor  Duffy.  My 
shoulders  tensed,  and  I  stared 
at  my  socks,  refusing  to  see 
his  reaction  to  my  story.  A 
story  I’d  never  told  anyone 
but  Casey. 

“So  I  saw  him  hanging  out 
with  this  girl  a  few  times  at 
school,”  I  continued.  “Every 
time  I  asked,  he  just  said  they 


were  friends  and  not  to 
worry.  So  I  didn’t.  I  mean,  he 
told  me  he  loved  me.  I  had 
every  reason  to  believe  him. 
Right?” 

Wesley  didn’t  answer. 

“Then  she  found  out.  This 
girl  I’d  been  seeing  him  with 
tracked  me  down  at  school 
one  day,  and  she  told  me  to 
stop  screwing  her  boyfriend.  I 
thought  it  was  a  mistake,  so  I 
asked  him  about  it. . .” 


“Not  a  mistake,”  Wesley 
guessed. 

“Nope.  Her  name  was 
Tiffany,  and  they’d  been 
together  since  seventh  grade. 
I  was  the  other  woman — or 
girl,  technically.” 

Slowly,  I  looked  up  and 
saw  Wesley  making  a  face. 
“What  a  dick,”  he  said. 

“You  can’t  talk.  You’re 
the  biggest  playboy  there  is.” 

“True,”  he  admitted.  “But 


I  don’t  make  promises.  He 
told  you  he  loved  you.  He 
made  a  commitment.  I’d 
never  do  that.  A  girl  can 
believe  what  she  wants  to 
believe,  but  I  don’t  say 
anything  I  don’t  mean.  What 
he  did  is  the  mark  of  a  true 
dick .” 

“Anyway,  he’s  back  in 
town  this  week  with 
Tiffany...  his  fiancee .” 

Wesley  let  out  a  low  hiss. 


“Ah,  that’s  awkward.” 

“You  think?” 

There  was  a  long  pause. 
Finally,  Wesley  asked,  “So, 
who  is  he?  Would  I 
remember  him?” 

“I  don’t  know.  You  might. 
His  name  is  Jake  Gaither.” 

“Jake  Gaither.”  Wesley’s 
face  twisted  in  horror.  “Jake 
Gaither?  You  mean  that 
strange  guy?  The  freak  with 
the  acne  and  hooked  nose?” 


His  eyes  widened  in  shock. 
“How  the  hell  did  he  get  two 
girls?  Why  would  anyone  go 
out  with  him?  Why  would 
you  go  out  with  him?  He  was 
a  beast.” 

I  felt  my  eyebrows 
contract.  “Thanks,”  I 
muttered.  “Did  you  ever  think 
that  maybe  that’s  the  best  that 
the  Duff  could  do?” 

Wesley’s  face  fell.  He 
looked  away  from  me, 


examining  our  reflections  in 
the  mirror  across  the  room. 
After  a  few  moments  of 
uneasy  silence,  he  said,  “You 
know,  Bianca,  you  aren’t  that 
unattractive.  You  do  have 
some  potential.  Maybe  if  you 
hung  out  with  different 
friends — ” 

“Just  stop,”  I  said.  “Look, 
I’ve  already  fucked  you 
twice.  You  don’t  have  to 
flatter  me.  Besides,  I  love  my 


friends  way  too  much  to  trade 
them  in  for  the  sake  of 
looking  hotter.” 

“Seriously?” 

“Yeah.  I  mean,  Casey  has 
been  my  best  friend  since, 
like,  forever,  and  she’s  the 
most  loyal  person  I’ve  ever 
met.  And  Jessica. . .  well,  she 
has  no  idea  about  me  and  her 
brother.  We  weren’t  friends 
back  then.  In  fact,  I  didn’t 
want  to  know  her  after  Jake 


and  I  split,  but  Casey  said  it 
would  be  good  for  me,  and 
she  was  right. . .  as  usual. 
Jessica  can  be  a  little  ditsy, 
but  she’s  the  sweetest,  most 
innocent  person  I  know.  I 
could  never  give  either  of 
them  up  just  to  look  good. 
That’d  make  me  a  real 
dumbass.” 

“Then  they’re  lucky  to 
have  you.” 

“I  just  said  not  to  flatter 


•)’) 


“I’m  being  honest.” 
Wesley  frowned  at  the  mirror. 
“I  have  only  one  friend — one 
real  friend.  Harrison  is  the 
only  guy  who  will  be  seen 
with  me,  and  that’s  because 
we  aren’t  trying  to  attract  the 
same  audience,  if  you  know 
what  I  mean.”  A  small  smile 
spread  across  his  lips  when  he 
turned  to  face  me.  “Most 
people  will  do  anything  to 


avoid  being  the  Duff.” 

“Well,  I  guess  I’m  not 
most  people.” 

He  looked  at  me  seriously. 
“Does  the  word  even  bother 
you?”  he  asked. 

“No.”  I  knew  it  was  a  lie 
the  second  the  answer  passed 
my  lips.  It  did  bother  me,  but 
I  wouldn’t  admit  that. 
Especially  not  to  him. 

My  entire  body  seemed  to 
be  conscious  of  his  eyes  on 


me  again.  Before  he  could 
say  anything,  I  stood  up  and 
walked  to  the  bedroom  door. 

“Listen,”  I  said,  twisting 
the  knob.  “I  have  to  go,  but  I 
was  thinking  we  should  do 
this  again.  Like  a  fling, 
maybe.  Purely  physical.  No 
strings  attached?” 

“Can’t  get  enough  of  me, 
can  you?”  Wesley  asked, 
stretching  out  on  his  back 
again  with  a  smirk.  “That 


sounds  good  to  me,  but  if  I’m 
so  fantastic,  you  should 
spread  the  word  to  your 
friends.  You  say  you  love 
them,  so  you  ought  to  let 
them  experience  the  same 
mind-blowing  pleasure. . . 
maybe  at  the  same  time.  It’s 
only  right.” 

I  scowled  at  him.  “Just 
when  I  think  you  might  have 
a  soul,  you  say  shit  like  that.” 
The  door  thudded  against  the 


wall  when  I  flung  it  open.  I 
marched  down  the  stairs  and 
yelled,  “I’ll  let  myself  out!” 

“I’ll  see  you  soon,  Duffy.” 

What  an  asshole. 

My  father  was  oblivious.  I 
guess  his  suspicious  dad 
mode  was  faulty  or 
something  because  he  hardly 
questioned  me  as  I  slipped 
out  of  the  house  to  go  see 
Wesley  more  and  more  that 


week.  Any  sane  dad  would 
have  been  tipped  off  when  his 
daughter  used  the  “working 
on  a  paper”  excuse  twice  in  a 
row,  but  four  times  in  one 
week?  Did  he  really  think  it 
took  me  that  long  to  write  a 
stupid  essay?  Wasn’t  he 
worried  I  might  be  out  doing 
exactly  what  I  was  doing? 

Apparently  not.  Every 
time  I  walked  out  of  the 
house,  he  just  said,  “Have  a 


nice  time,  Bumblebee.” 

But  I  think  cluelessness 
must  have  been  in  the  air. 
Even  Casey,  who’d  been 
watching  me  like  a  hawk 
since  Jake  drove  into  town, 
hadn’t  picked  up  on  anything 
between  me  and  Wesley. 
Nothing  more  than  her  usual 
jokes  about  my  secret  pining 
for  him,  that  is.  Of  course,  I 
was  doing  everything  I  could 
to  hide  the  evidence,  but 


more  than  once,  I  was  sure 
she’d  caught  me. 

Like  Friday  afternoon 
when  we  were  hanging  out  in 
my  bedroom  and  getting 
ready  to  go  to  the  Nest. 
Really,  Casey  was  the  one 
getting  ready.  I  mostly  just 
sat  on  my  bed  and  watched 
while  she  posed  in  front  of 
my  mirror.  We’d  done  this  a 
million  times,  but  with 
Jessica  still  clinging  to  her 


brother  every  waking 
moment,  the  room  felt 
strangely  empty.  Almost 
eerie. 

Jessica  was  so  different 
from  both  of  us.  I  mean, 
Casey  and  I  were  opposites, 
but  Jessica  was  from  an 
entirely  different  planet.  She 
was  a  constant  ray  of  light. 
The  glass  half  full.  She  kept 
us  balanced  with  that  big 
smile  and  naive  innocence 


that  always  shocked  us. 

While  sometimes  it  felt  like 
Casey  and  I  had  both  seen  too 
much  of  the  world,  Jessica 
was,  in  a  lot  of  ways,  still  a 
child.  Virginal.  Always  full 
of  wonder.  She  was  our 
sunshine,  and  Casey  and  I 
were  kind  of  in  the  dark 
without  her. 

I  was  wondering  how 
many  more  days  Jake  would 
be  in  town,  when  Casey 


turned  to  look  at  me, 
apparently  deciding  that  she 
liked  her  purple  skinny  jeans 
after  all.  (I’m  glad  she  did, 
because  I  thought  they  were 
hideous.)  “You  know,  B, 
you’re  dealing  with  this 
whole  Jake  thing  a  lot  better 
than  I  expected,”  she  said. 

“Thanks. . .  I  think.” 

“Well,  I  kind  of  figured 
that  when  Jake  rolled  back 
into  Hamilton  with  his 


fiancee,  you’d  be  freaked.  I 
was  banking  on  tears, 
midnight  phone  calls,  and 
some  good  old  nervous 
breakdowns.  Instead,  you’re 
being,  like,  totally  normal. . . 
or,  you  know,  as  normal  as 
Bianca  Piper  ever  gets.” 

“I  retract  my  thanks.” 

“Seriously.”  She  crossed 
the  room  and  sat  down  next 
to  me.  “Are  you  dealing  with 
this  okay?  You’ve  barely 


complained,  which  is 
disturbing  because  you 
complain  about  everything.” 

“Do  not,”  I  protested. 

“Whatever  you  say.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes.  “For 
your  information,  I’ve  found 
a  way  to  take  my  mind  off  it, 
but  that’s  kind  of  ruined  when 
you  keep  talking  about  it, 
Casey.”  I  nudged  her 
playfully  with  my  elbow. 

“I’m  starting  to  think  that  you 


want  me  to  cry.” 

“At  least  that  would  prove 
to  me  that  you’re  not  bottling 
it  up.” 

“Casey,”  I  groaned. 

“I’m  not  kidding,  B,”  she 
said.  “This  guy  really  fucked 
you  up  freshman  year.  You 
were  a  crying,  blubbering, 
panicking  mess  after  what  he 
did,  and  I  know  it’s  hard 
because  we  have  to  keep  it 
from  Jess,  but  you  need  to 


deal  with  it  somehow.  I  don’t 
want  to  see  you  go  through 
that  shit  again.” 

“Casey,  I’m  fine,”  I 
assured  her.  “I  really  have 
found  a  way  to  relieve  the 
stress,  okay?” 

“What’s  that?” 

Oh,  shit. 

“What’s  what?” 

Casey  frowned  at  me. 
“Duh.  Your  way  of  relieving 
the  stress.  What  are  you 


doing?” 

“Um...  just  stuff.” 

“Are  you  working  out?” 
she  asked.  “Don’t  be 
embarrassed  if  you  are.  My 
mom  does  cardio  when  she’s 
pissed  off.  She  says  it  helps 
her  channel  the  negative 
energy — whatever  that 
means.  So  is  that  what  you’re 
doing?  Are  you  working 
out?” 

“Um. . .  you  could  say 


that.” 

Damn  it.  My  cheeks  were 
definitely  burning.  I  turned 
away  from  her,  examining  the 
hairs  on  the  back  of  my  arm. 

“Cardio?” 

“Mmm-hmm.” 

But  miraculously,  she 
didn’t  seem  to  notice  that  my 
face  was  on  fire. 

“Cool.  You  know,  these 
pants  are  a  size  bigger  than 
what  I  usually  buy.  Maybe 


we  should  work  out  together. 
It  could  be  fun.” 

“I  don’t  think  so.”  Before 
she  could  argue  or  see  the 
scarlet  color  of  my  cheeks,  I 
stood  up  and  said,  “I’ve  gotta 
go  brush  my  teeth  again. 

Then  I’ll  be  ready  to  get  out 
of  here.  Okay?”  And  I  ran  out 
of  the  room. 

When  I  returned  a  few 
minutes  later,  I  was  forced  to 
lie  yet  again. 


“Wanna  stay  over  at  my 
place  tonight?”  Casey  asked 
as  she  fluffed  her  short  hair  in 
the  mirror.  “Mom’s  going  to 
a  bachelorette  party  for  a 
woman  she  works  with,  so 
it’ll  just  be  us. . .  and  a  few 
James  McAvoy  movies  if  you 
want.  Jess  will  be  sad  she 
missed  it,  but — ” 

“I  can’t  tonight,  Casey.” 
“Why  not?”  She  sounded 
hurt. 


The  truth  was  that  I  had 
plans  to  see  Wesley  around 
eleven  that  night,  but 
obviously  I  couldn’t  just  be 
honest.  But  I  couldn’t  really 
lie  either.  I  mean,  my  lies 
were  always  so  fucking 
transparent.  Sol  did  what  I 
was  getting  better  and  better 
at  these  days.  I  withheld. 

“I  have  plans.” 

“After  we  leave  the  Nest?” 

“Yeah.  Sorry.” 


Casey  turned  from  the 
mirror  and  stared  at  me  for  a 
long  moment.  Finally,  she 
said,  “You’ve  been  busy  a  lot 
lately,  you  know.  You  never 
want  to  do  stuff  with  me 
much  anymore.” 

“I’m  going  out  with  you 
tonight,  aren’t  I?”  I  asked. 

“Yeah,  I  guess,  but. . .  I 
don’t  know.”  She  turned 
away  and  examined  her 
reflection  one  last  time. 


“Never  mind.  Let’s  just  go.” 

God,  I  hated  being 
dishonest  with  Casey. 
Especially  because  she 
clearly  knew  something  was 
going  on,  even  if  she  hadn’t 
figured  out  what  just  yet.  But 
I  was  going  to  do  everything 
in  my  power  to  keep  my  thing 
with  Wesley  under  wraps. 

And,  of  course,  Wesley 
acted  totally  casual  about 
everything.  In  public,  we 


treated  each  other  with  the 
same  sarcastic  indifference  as 
always.  I  insulted  him,  gave 
him  dirty  looks,  and  cursed 
under  my  breath  as  he  acted 
like  a  pig  (not  that  there  was 
any  acting  involved).  No  one 
would  have  guessed  we  were 
different  behind  closed  doors. 
No  one  could  tell  that  I  was 
counting  down  the  minutes 
until  we’d  be  meeting  on  his 
front  porch  step. 


No  one  but  Joe. 

“You  like  him,”  the 
bartender  teased  as  Wesley, 
after  enduring  a  verbal  tirade 
from  yours  truly,  went  off  to 
dance  with  a  giggling  bimbo. 
“And  I’m  thinking  he  likes 
you,  too.  You  two  have 
something  going  on.” 

“You’re  insane,”  I  said, 
sipping  my  Cherry  Coke. 

“I’ve  told  you  a  million 
times,  Bianca,  and  I’ll  tell 


you  again.  You’re  a  bad  liar.” 

“I  wouldn’t  touch  that 
douche  bag  with  a  ten- foot 
pole!”  Did  my  voice  convey 
enough  disgust?  “Do  you 
really  think  I’m  that  much  of 
an  idiot,  Joe?  He’s  arrogant, 
and  he  sleeps  with  everything 
he  can  get  his  filthy  hands  on. 
Most  of  the  time,  I  just  want 
to  claw  his  creepy  eyes  out. 
How  could  I  like  him?  He’s  a 
jackass.” 


“And  girls  love  jackasses. 
That’s  why  I  can’t  get  a  date. 
I’m  too  damn  nice.” 

“Or  too  hairy,”  I  offered.  I 
took  the  last  drink  of  my 
Cherry  Coke  and  pushed  my 
glass  across  the  bar  to  him. 
“Shave  that  Moses  beard  and 
you  might  have  better  luck. 
Women  don’t  want  to  kiss 
carpet,  you  know.” 

“You’re  trying  to  get  out 
of  talking  about  it,”  Joe 


pointed  out.  “That  just  proves 
there’s  something  going  on 
with  you  and  Mr.  Jackass.” 

“Shut  up.  Just  shut  up, 
Joe.” 

“So  I’m  right?” 

“No,”  I  said.  “You’re  just 
really,  really  annoying  me.” 

Okay,  I  definitely  had  to 
find  some  way  of  avoiding 
the  Nest  for  a  few  weeks. . . 
or,  better  yet  .forever.

“Your  shot,  Duffy.”  Wesley 
leaned  on  his  pool  stick,  a 
triumphant  smirk  on  his  face. 

“You  haven’t  won  yet,”  I 
said,  rolling  my  eyes. 

“But  I’m  about  to.” 

I  ignored  him,  focusing 
my  attention  on  one  of  the 


two  striped  balls  still 
remaining  on  the  table.  At 
that  point,  I  really  wished 
Wesley  and  I  had  just  stuck  to 
our  pattern — walk  straight  up 
to  his  bedroom,  bypassing 
everything  else  entirely.  But 
that  night  on  the  way  up  the 
stairs,  Wesley  had  mentioned 
having  a  pool  table — and 
proceeded  to  brag  that  he  was 
a  wizard  with  a  pool  stick. 

For  some  reason,  it  sparked  a 


competitive  nerve  in  me.  I 
just  couldn’t  wait  to  wipe  the 
floor  with  him  and  knock  that 
cocky  little  grin  right  off  his 
face. 

Only,  I  was  starting  to 
regret  my  decision  to 
challenge  him  to  this  game 
because,  as  it  turned  out,  his 
boasts  hadn’t  been  too  far 
from  the  truth.  I  wasn’t  bad  at 
pool  either,  but  I  was  about  to 
get  my  ass  kicked.  And  there 


was  nothing  I  could  do  to 
wiggle  my  way  out  of  it. 

“Steady  there,”  he 
whispered,  his  lips  brushing 
past  my  ear  as  he  eased  up 
behind  me.  His  hands  settled 
on  my  hips,  fingers  toying 
with  the  hem  of  my  shirt. 
“Focus,  Duffy.  Are  you 
focusing?” 

He  was  trying  to  distract 
me.  And  shit,  it  was  working. 

I  jerked  away  from  him, 


trying  to  thrust  the  back  of 
my  pool  stick  into  his  gut. 
But  of  course  he  dodged,  and 
I  succeeded  only  in  knocking 
the  cue  ball  in  the  opposite 
direction  of  what  I’d 
intended,  sending  it  right  into 
one  of  the  corner  pockets. 

“Scratch,”  Wesley 
announced. 

“Damn  it!”  I  whirled 
around  to  face  him.  “That 
shouldn’t  count!” 


“But  it  does.”  He  took  the 
white  ball  out  of  the  hole  and 
placed  it  carefully  at  the  end 
of  the  table.  “All’s  fair  in  love 
and  pool.” 

“War,”  I  corrected. 

“Same  thing.”  He  eased 
the  stick  back,  staring  straight 
ahead,  before  shooting  it 
forward  again.  Half  a  second 
later,  the  eight  ball  sailed  into 
a  pocket.  The  winning  shot. 

“Asshole,”  I  hissed. 


“Don’t  be  a  sore  loser,”  he 
said,  leaning  his  stick  against 
the  wall.  “What  did  you 
really  expect?  I’m  obviously 
amazing  at  everything.”  He 
grinned.  “But,  hey,  you  can’t 
hold  it  against  me,  right?  We 
can’t  help  the  way  God 
makes  us.” 

“You’re  an  arrogant 
cheater.”  I  tossed  my  pool 
stick  aside,  letting  it  clatter  to 
the  floor  a  few  feet  away. 


“Sore  winners  are  way  worse 
than  sore  losers,  you  know. 
And  you  only  won  because 
you  kept  messing  me  up!  You 
couldn’t  keep  your  fucking 
hands  to  yourself  long 
enough  for  me  to  make  a 
decent  shot!  That’s  just  low. 
And  for  another  thing — ” 
Without  warning,  Wesley 
lifted  me  up  onto  the  pool 
table.  His  hands  moved  to  my 
shoulders,  and  a  second  later, 


I  was  flat  on  my  back,  staring 
up  at  him  as  he  smirked.  He 
shifted  so  that  he  was  on  the 
table  too,  leaning  over  me 
with  his  face  only  inches 
from  mine. 

“On  the  pool  table?”  I 
said,  narrowing  my  eyes  at 
him.  “Seriously?” 

“I  can’t  resist,”  he  said. 
“You  know,  you’re  pretty 
sexy  when  you’re  pissed  at 
me,  Duffy.” 


First,  I  was  struck  by  the 
irony  of  that  statement.  I 
mean,  he  used  sexy  and  Duffy 
— implying  I  was  fat  and  ugly 
— in  the  same  sentence.  The 
contrast  was  almost 
laughable.  Almost. 

The  thing  that  really  got 
me,  though,  was  that  no  one, 
not  even  Jake  Gaither,  had 
ever  called  me  sexy.  Wesley 
was  the  first.  And  the  truth 
was,  being  with  him  made  me 


feel  attractive.  The  way  he 
touched  me.  The  way  he 
kissed  me.  I  could  tell  his 
body  wanted  me.  Okay,  okay. 
So  it  was  Wesley.  His  body 
wanted  everyone.  But  still.  It 
was  a  feeling  I  hadn’t 
experienced  in. . .  well,  I’d 
never  experienced  it.  It  was 
exciting  and  empowering. 

But  none  of  that  could 
erase  the  stab  of  pain  the  last 
word  in  his  statement  gave 


me.  Wesley  might  have  been 
the  first  to  call  me  sexy,  but 
he  was  also  the  first  to  call 
me  the  Duff  That  word  had 
been  tugging  at  me,  taunting 
me,  for  weeks  now.  And  it 
was  his  fault. 

So  how  could  he  see  me 
as  both  sexy  and  Duffy  at  the 
same  time? 

Better  question:  why  did  I 
care? 

Before  I  could 


manufacture  any  decent 
answers,  he  started  kissing 
me,  his  fingers  already 
locating  the  buttons  and 
zippers  of  my  clothes.  We 
became  a  tangle  of  lips  and 
hands  and  knees,  and  the 
issue  was  completely  pushed 
out  of  my  head. 

For  the  moment,  at  least. 

“Go  Panthers!”  Casey  yelled 
as  she  and  a  few  other 


members  of  the  Skinny  Squad 
did  cartwheels  along  the 
sidelines. 

Beside  me,  Jessica  was 
waving  a  two-dollar  blue- 
and-orange  pom-pom,  her 
face  glowing  with 
excitement.  Jake  and  Tiffany 
were  having  dinner  with 
Tiffany’s  parents  that  night, 
which  meant  I  got  to  spend  a 
couple  of  hours  with  her. . . 
even  if  that  couple  of  hours 


was  at  a  stupid  sporting 
event. 

The  truth  was,  I  hated 
pretty  much  anything 
requiring  school  spirit, 
because,  obviously,  I  had 
none.  I  hated  Hamilton  High. 
I  hated  the  horribly  bright 
school  colors,  the  incredibly 
generic  mascot,  and  at  least 
ninety  percent  of  the  student 
body.  That’s  why  I  couldn’t 
wait  to  leave  for  college. 


“You  hate  everything,” 
Casey  had  said  to  me  early 
that  day  when  I’d  explained 
to  her  why  I  had  no  desire  to 
attend  the  basketball  game. 

“That  isn’t  true.” 

“Yes,  it  is.  You  hate 
everything.  But  I  love  you. 
And  Jess.  Which  is  why  I  am 
going  to  ask  you,  as  your  best 
friend,  to  bring  her  to  the 
game.” 

When  Jessica  had  told  me 


she  wanted  to  hang  out  that 
night,  my  first  instinct  was  to 
just  go  to  my  place  and  watch 
movies.  But  Casey’s 
obligations  to  cheer  at  the 
game  had  interfered.  That 
might  not  have  been  a  big 
deal — Jessica  and  I  could 
have  watched  movies  on  our 
own — but  Casey  had  to  make 
it  so  complicated.  She  wanted 
to  see  Jessica,  too.  And  she 
wanted  us  to  see  her  cheer. 


Even  if  it  went  against 
everything  I  stood  for. 

“Come  on,  B,”  she  said, 
sounding  irritated.  “It’s  just 
one  game.” 

She  was  irritated  a  lot 
these  days.  Especially  at  me. 
And  I  really  wasn’t  in  the 
mood  to  argue  with  her. 

So  that’s  how  I’d  been 
wangled  into  this.  That’s  how 
I’d  wound  up  sitting  on  an 
uncomfortable  bleacher, 


bored  out  of  my  mind,  as  the 
cheers  and  shouts  of  the 
people  around  me  brought  on 
a  fucking  migraine. 
Absolutely  wonderful. 

I’d  just  decided  to  drive  to 
Wesley’s  after  the  game, 
when  Jessica  elbowed  me  in 
the  side.  For  a  second  I 
assumed  it  was  an  accident, 
like  she’d  gotten  a  little  too 
excited  waving  her  pom-pom 
around,  but  then  I  felt  her  tug 


on  my  wrist.  “Bianca.” 

“Huh?”  I  turned  my  head 
to  face  her,  but  she  wasn’t 
looking  at  me.  Her  gaze  was 
focused  on  a  group  of  people 
a  few  bleachers  down. 

Three  tall,  pretty  girls — 
juniors,  I  thought — sat  in  a 
row,  leaning  back  on  their 
palms,  their  legs  crossed. 
Three  perfect  ponytails.  Three 
pairs  of  hip-hugger  j  eans . 

And  then,  up  the  aisle, 


walked  the  fourth.  She  was 
smaller  and  paler  with  short 
black  hair.  Clearly  a 
freshman.  She  was  carrying 
several  bottles  of  water  and  a 
few  hot  dogs  in  her  arms,  like 
she’d  just  come  back  from  the 
concession  stand. 

I  watched  as  the  smiling 
freshman  passed  out  the 
bottles  and  food.  Watched  as 
each  of  the  juniors  took  theirs 
from  her.  Watched  as  they 


gave  her  less  than 
appreciative  looks.  She  took 
her  seat  at  the  end  of  their 
little  row,  and  none  of  the 
older  girls  seemed  to  talk  to 
her,  only  to  one  another.  I 
watched  as  she  tried  to  hop 
into  their  conversations,  her 
small  mouth  opening  and 
closing  again  as  each  of  the 
juniors  interrupted  her, 
ignoring  her  entirely.  Until, 
after  a  moment,  one  faced 


her,  spoke  quickly,  and 
looked  back  to  her  friends. 
The  freshman  stood  up  again 
and  walked,  still  smiling, 
down  the  steps  and  back 
toward  the  concession  stand. 
Back  to  do  their  bidding. 

When  I  faced  Jessica 
again,  her  eyes  were  dark 
and. . .  sad.  Or  maybe  angry. 
It  was  hard  to  tell  with  her 
because  she  didn’t  show 
either  of  those  emotions  very 


often. 

Either  way  I  understood. 

Jessica  had  been  like  that 
freshman  once.  That’s  how 
Casey  and  I  had  found  her. 
Two  senior  girls  Casey 
cheered  with — complete 
cheerleading  stereotypes: 
bitchy,  blond,  and  bimbo-like 
— had  been  bragging  about 
some  dopey  sophomore  they 
kept  as  a  “pet.”  And,  more 
than  once,  Casey  had  watched 


them  talk  down  to  her. 

“We’ve  got  to  do 
something  about  it,  B,”  she’d 
said  insistently.  “We  can’t 
just  let  them  treat  her  that 
way.” 

Casey  thought  she  had  to 
save  everyone.  Just  like  she’d 
saved  me  on  the  playground 
all  those  years  ago.  I  was 
used  to  this.  Only  this  time, 
she  wanted  my  help. 
Normally  I  would  have 


agreed  just  because  it  was 
Casey  asking.  But  Jessica 
Gaither  was  a  girl  I  had  no 
desire  to  even  meet,  let  alone 
save. 

It  wasn’t  that  I  was 
heartless.  I  just  didn’t  want  to 
know  Jake  Gaither’s  sister. 
Not  after  what  he’d  done  to 
me.  Not  after  the  drama  I’d 
been  through  the  year  before. 

And  I’d  managed  to  stand 
my  ground  quite  firmly. . . 


until  that  day  in  the  cafeteria. 

“God,  Jessica,  are  you 
fucking  brain-dead  or 
something?” 

Casey  and  I  both  turned 
around  in  our  seats  to  see  one 
of  the  skinny  cheerleaders 
glaring  down  at  Jessica,  who 
was  at  least  a  head  shorter 
than  she  was.  Or  maybe  that 
was  just  the  way  Jessica 
slumped,  cowering. 

“I  asked  you  to  do  one 


simple  thing,”  the  cheerleader 
spat,  jabbing  a  finger  down  at 
the  plate  Jessica  was  holding. 
“One  stupidly  simple  thing. 
No  fucking  dressing  on  my 
salad.  How  hard  is  that?” 

“That’s  how  the  salad 
came,  Mia,”  Jessica 
mumbled,  her  cheeks  bright 
pink.  “I  didn’t — ” 

“You’re  a  moron.”  The 
cheerleader  turned  around 
and  stormed  away,  ponytail 


swinging  behind  her. 

Jessica  just  stood  there, 
looking  down  at  the  plate  of 
salad  with  big,  sad  eyes.  She 
seemed  so  small  then.  So 
weak  and  mousy.  At  that 
moment,  I  didn’t  think  of  her 
as  beautiful.  Or  even  all  that 
cute.  Just  fragile  and  skittish. 
Like  a  mouse. 

“Hurry  up,  Jessica,”  one 
of  the  other  cheerleaders 
called  from  their  table, 


sounding  annoyed.  “We’re 
not  saving  your  seat  forever. 
Jesus.” 

I  could  feel  Casey  looking 
at  me,  and  I  knew  what  she 
wanted.  And,  staring  at 
Jessica,  I  couldn’t  exactly 
pretend  I  didn’t  understand 
why.  If  anyone  needed  a  little 
bit  of  Casey  Saves  the  Day,  it 
was  this  girl.  Plus,  she  didn’t 
look  anything  like  her 
brother.  That  made  my 


decision  a  little  easier. 

I  sighed  and  said,  loudly, 
“Hey,  Jessica.” 

She  jumped  and  turned  to 
look  at  me,  and  the  fearful 
expression  on  her  face  almost 
broke  my  heart. 

“Come  sit  with  us.”  It 
wasn’t  a  question.  Not  even 
an  offer.  It  was  pretty  much 
an  order.  I  didn’t  want  to  give 
her  a  choice.  Even  though,  if 
she  was  sane,  she  totally 


would  have  chosen  us. 

Then  Jessica  was  hurrying 
toward  us,  and  the  senior 
cheerleaders  were  pissed,  and 
Casey  was  beaming  at  me. 
And  that  was  that.  History. 

Though  it  didn’t  seem  so 
much  like  the  past  just  then, 
as  I  watched  the  little 
freshman  girl  hurry  off 
toward  the  concession  stand.  I 
could  see  the  way  her  jeans 
hung  on  her  wrong — she 


didn’t  quite  have  the  curves 
for  low-rise  pants — and  that 
awkward  slouch  in  her 
shoulders  that  made  her  look 
strangely  unbalanced.  Those 
little  things  that  separated  her 
from  her  so-called  friends.  A 
walking  echo  of  the  girl 
Jessica  had  been.  So  long 
ago.  Only  now  I  had  a  new 
word  for  it.  For  that  girl. 

Duff. 

There  was  no  way  around 


it.  That  freshman  was 
definitely  the  Duff  in 
comparison  to  the  pretty 
bitches  bossing  her  around.  It 
wasn’t  that  she  was  so 
unattractive — and  she 
definitely  wasn’t  fat — but  out 
of  the  four  of  them,  she  was 
the  last  one  anyone  would 
notice.  And  I  couldn’t  help 
wondering  if  that  was  the 
point.  If  they  used  her  as 
more  than  just  the  errand 


runner.  Was  she  there  also  to 
make  them  look  better? 

I  looked  at  Jessica  again, 
remembering  how  small  and 
weak  she’d  seemed  that  day. 
Not  cute.  Not  pretty.  Just  kind 
of  pathetic.  The  Duff.  Now 
she  was  beautiful. 

Voluptuous  and  adorable 
and. . .  well,  sexy.  Any  guy — 
except  Harrison, 
unfortunately — would  want 
her.  But  the  strange  thing 


was,  she  didn’t  look  all  that 
different.  Not  on  the  surface, 
at  least.  She’d  been  curvy  and 
blond  even  then.  So  what  had 
changed? 

How  could  one  of  the 
most  gorgeous  girls  I’d  ever 
met  have  been  the  Duff?  How 
did  that  logic  even  work?  It 
was  like  Wesley  calling  me 
sexy  and  Duffy  at  the  same 
time.  It  just  didn’t  make 


sense. 


Was  it  possible  that  you 
didn’t  have  to  be  fat  or  ugly 
to  be  the  Duff?  I  mean, 
Wesley  had  said,  that  night  at 
the  Nest,  that  Duff  was  a 
comparison.  Did  that  mean 
even  somewhat  attractive 
girls  could  be  Duffs? 

“Should  we  go  help  her?” 

I  was  startled  for  a  second, 
and  a  little  confused.  I 
realized  Jessica  was  watching 
the  freshman  make  her  way 


down  the  sideline. 

I  had  a  horrible  thought 
then.  One  that  officially  made 
me  the  biggest  bitch  ever.  I 
seriously  considered  going 
and  claiming  that  freshman  as 
our  own,  so  that  maybe,  just 
maybe,  I  wouldn’t  be  the 
Duff  anymore. 

I  could  hear  Wesley’s 
voice  in  my  head.  “ Most 
people  will  do  anything  to 
avoid  being  the  Duff.  ”  I’d 


said  I  wasn’t  most  people,  but 
was  I?  Was  I  just  like  those 
cheerleaders — now  long  since 
graduated — who’d  mistreated 
Jessica  or  like  these  three 
perfect  ponytailed  juniors  on 
the  bleachers? 

Before  I  could  make  a 
decision,  though,  to  help  the 
freshman — be  it  for  the  right 
reasons  or  the  wrong — the 
buzzer  sounded  over  our 
heads.  Around  us,  the  crowd 


stood,  all  cheering  and 
whooping,  blocking  my  view 
of  the  small,  dark-haired 
figure.  She  was  gone,  and  so 
was  my  opportunity  to  save 
her  or  use  her  or  whatever  I 
might  have  done. 

The  game  was  over. 

The  Panthers  had  won. 

And  I  was  still  the  Duff. 


13 


Valentine’s  Day  might  as 
well  have  been  called  Anti- 
Duff  Day.  I  mean,  what  other 
day  can  hurt  a  girl’s  self¬ 
esteem  more?  Not  that  it 
mattered.  I  hated  Valentine’s 
Day  even  before  I  was  aware 
of  my  Duff  status.  Honestly,  I 


didn’t  even  understand  why  it 
was  a  holiday.  Really,  it  was 
just  an  excuse  for  girls  to 
whine  about  being  lonely  and 
for  guys  to  worm  their  way 
into  getting  laid.  I  found  it 
materialistic,  indulgent,  and, 
with  all  of  the  chocolate, 
completely  unhealthy. 

“It’s  my  favorite  day  of 
the  year!”  Jessica  cried  as  she 
danced  her  way  down  the  hall 
toward  Spanish  one  morning. 


It  was  the  first  time  I’d  seen 
her  truly  bouncy  since  Jake’s 
departure  two  days  earlier. 
“All  of  the  pink  and  red!  And 
flowers  and  candy!  Isn’t  it 
fun,  Bianca?” 

“Sure.” 

It  had  been  almost  a  week 
since  the  basketball  game, 
and  neither  of  us  had 
mentioned  the  freshman  girl 
since  we  left  the  gym  that 
night.  I  wondered  if  Jessica 


had  forgotten  about  it  already. 
Lucky  her.  I  hadn’t.  I 
couldn’t.  That  girl  and  the 
thing  we  had  in  common — 
our  shared  identity  as  Duffs 
— had  been  lurking  at  the 
back  of  my  mind  ever  since. 

But  I  certainly  wasn’t 
going  to  talk  about  it.  Not 
with  Jessica.  Not  with 
anyone. 

“Oh,  I  just  wish  Harrison 
had  asked  me  to  be  his 


valentine,”  she  said.  “That 
would  have  been  perfect,  but 
we  can’t  always  get  what  we 
want,  can  we?” 

“Nope.” 

“You  know,  I  think  this  is 
the  first  year  that  all  three  of 
us  have  been  single,”  Jessica 
continued.  “Last  year,  I  was 
dating  Terrence,  and  the  year 
before  that  Casey  was  with 
Zack.  I  guess  we  can  all  just 
be  each  other’s  valentines. 


That  would  be  pretty  fun.  It  is 
our  last  Valentine’s  Day 
together  before  college,  and 
we  haven’t  really  hung  out 
together  lately.  What  do  you 
think?  We  can  hang  out  at  my 
house  to  celebrate.” 

“Sounds  good.” 

Jessica  threw  an  arm 
around  my  shoulders.  “Happy 
Valentine’s  Day,  Bianca!” 

“You  too,  Jessica.”  I 
smiled  in  spite  of  myself.  I 


couldn’t  help  it.  Jessica  had 
one  of  those  contagious 
smiles  that  made  it  really  hard 
to  be  negative  when  she  was 
so  freaking  bubbly. 

We  reached  the  classroom 
door  and  found  our  teacher 
waiting  for  us  inside. 
“Bianca,”  she  said  as  I 
walked  in.  “I  just  got  an  e- 
mail  from  one  of  the 
secretaries  at  the  front  desk. 
She  needs  some  students  to 


come  help  distribute  flowers 
people  have  sent.  You’re 
caught  up  on  all  your  work, 
so  would  you  mind  doing  that 
for  me?” 

“Urn...  okay.” 

“Oh,  how  fun!”  Jessica 
released  me  from  her  one- 
armed  hug.  “You  get  to 
deliver  flowers.  It’s  almost 
like  you’re  playing  Cupid.” 

Right.  How  fun. 

“See  you  later,”  I  said  to 


Jessica  as  I  turned  and  walked 
right  back  out  of  the  room.  I 
pushed  through  the  hordes  of 
students,  fighting  against  the 
current  to  make  my  way  to 
the  front  desk.  Couples 
seemed  to  be  everywhere, 
displaying  their  affection — 
holding  hands,  batting  eyes, 
exchanging  gifts,  making  out 
— for  the  entire  school  to 
witness.  “Disgusting,”  I 
muttered. 


I  was  about  halfway  to  the 
front  desk  when  a  strong  hand 
gripped  my  elbow.  “Hello, 
Duffy.” 

“What  do  you  want?” 

Wesley  was  grinning  at 
me  when  I  spun  around  to 
face  him.  “I  just  wanted  to  let 
you  know  that  if  you  plan  on 
dropping  by  tonight,  I  might 
be  a  little  busy.  With  it  being 
the  day  of  love,  I  have  a 
pretty  full  schedule.” 


Now  he  sounded  like  a 
professional  man- whore. 

“But  if  you’re  desperate  to 
see  me,  I  should  be  free 
around  eleven  o’clock.” 

“I  think  I  can  survive  one 
night  without  you,  Wesley,”  I 
said.  “In  fact,  I  can  survive  an 
eternity.” 

“Sure  you  can.”  He 
released  my  arm  and  winked. 
“I’ll  see  you  tonight,  Duffy.” 
Then  he  was  gone,  swept 


away  by  the  tidal  wave  of 
students  on  the  verge  of  being 
late  for  class. 

“Prick,”  I  grumbled. 

“God,  I  hate  him.” 

A  few  minutes  later,  I 
stood  at  the  front  desk  where 
the  secretary,  who  looked  like 
a  nervous  wreck,  smiled  at 
me  with  relief.  “Did  Mrs. 
Romali  send  you?  This  way, 
this  way.  The  table  is  over 
here.”  She  led  me  around  the 


corner  and  gestured  to  a 
foldable,  square  table  with  a 
vomit- green  surface.  “There  it 
is.  Have  fun!” 

“Not  likely.” 

The  table  was  covered — I 
mean  covered — with 
bouquets,  vases,  heart-shaped 
boxes,  and  Hallmark  cards. 

At  least  fifty  bundles  of  red 
and  pink  waited  to  be  handed 
out,  and  I  got  the  privilege  of 
being  the  bringer  of  such  joy. 


I  was  debating  where  to 
start  when  I  heard  footsteps 
behind  me.  Assuming  the 
secretary  had  returned,  I 
asked,  without  turning 
around,  “Do  you  have  a  list  of 
the  classes  these  kids  are  in 
so  I  know  where  to  take  the 
gifts?” 

“Yes,  I  do.” 

That  didn’t  sound  like  the 
secretary. 

I  whirled  around,  shocked 


by  the  voice  that  had  replied. 
It  was  one  I  knew  very  well, 
despite  the  fact  that  it  had 
never — not  once — spoken 
directly  to  me. 

Toby  Tucker  smiled.  “Hi.” 

“Oh.  I  thought  you  were 
someone  else.” 

“I  didn’t  mean  to  scare 
you,”  he  said.  “So  you  were 
wangled  into  this,  too,  huh?” 

“Urn,  yeah.”  I  was 
relieved  to  find  my  vocal 


chords  weren’t  in  a  state  of 
paralysis. 

As  always,  Toby  was 
wearing  a  slightly-too- 
formal-for-school  blazer,  and 
his  blond  hair  fell  around  his 
face  in  that  old-fashioned 
bowl  cut.  Adorable.  Unique. 
Intelligent.  He  was  the 
embodiment  of  all  the  things  I 
wanted  in  a  guy.  If  I  believed 
in  stupid  things  like  fate,  I 
might  have  thought  it  was 


destiny  that  we  were  working 
together  on  Valentine’s  Day. 

“Here  are  the  class 
rosters,”  he  said,  handing  me 
a  green  binder.  “We  should 
probably  get  started;  this 
could  take  a  while.”  His  eyes 
scanned  the  field  of  gifts  from 
behind  his  oval  glasses.  “I 
don’t  think  I’ve  ever  seen  so 
much  pink  in  one  place.” 

“I  have.  My  best  friend’s 
bedroom.” 


Toby  chuckled  and  picked 
up  a  bouquet  of  pink  and 
white  roses.  He  eyed  the  tag 
and  said,  “The  quickest  way 
to  get  this  done  might  be  to 
separate  these  into  piles  based 
on  which  class  each  student  is 
in.  It  will  make  delivery 
much  more  efficient.” 

“Right,”  I  said.  “Organize 
by  class.  Okay.” 

I  was  quite  aware  of  how 
moronic  I  sounded  with  my 


less-than-eloquent  replies,  but 
there  wasn’t  much  I  could  do 
about  it.  I  mean,  just  because 
my  voice  actually  worked 
didn’t  necessarily  mean  I 
could  use  it  well  in  his 
presence.  I’d  been  crushing 
on  Toby  for  three  years,  so  to 
say  he  made  me  nervous 
would  be  a  massive 
understatement. 

Lucky  for  me,  Toby  didn’t 
seem  to  notice.  As  we  sorted 


the  various  gifts  into  groups, 
he  even  offered  up  some 
polite  small  talk.  Slowly,  I 
found  myself  easing  into  a 
semi-comfortable  chat  with 
Toby  Tucker.  A  Valentine’s 
Day  miracle!  Well,  miracle 
was  too  strong  a  word — a 
miracle  would  have  been  him 
sweeping  me  into  his  arms 
and  laying  one  on  me  right 
there.  So  maybe  this  was 
more  like  a  Valentine’s  Day 


benefit.  Either  way,  my 
awkward,  idiotic  dialogue 
began  to  ebb  away.  Thank 
God. 

“Wow,  there’s  a  lot  here 
for  Vikki  McPhee,”  he  said, 
placing  a  box  of  candy  on  top 
of  a  steadily  growing  pile. 
“Does  she  have  six 
boyfriends?” 

“I  only  know  about  three,” 
I  said.  “But  she  doesn’t  tell 
me  everything.” 


Toby  shook  his  head. 
“Jeez.”  He  picked  up  a  card 
and  began  to  check  the  label. 
“So  what  about  you?  Any 
Valentine’s  Day  plans?” 
“Nope.” 

He  put  the  card  in  one  of 
the  piles.  “Not  even  a  date 
with  the  boyfriend?” 

“That  would  require  me 
having  a  boyfriend,”  I  said. 
“Which  I  don’t.”  Not  wanting 
him  to  start  feeling  sorry  for 


me,  I  added,  “But  even  if  I 
did,  I  wouldn’t  be  doing 
anything  special.  Valentine’s 
Day  is  a  stupid,  pathetic 
excuse  for  a  holiday.” 

“You  really  think  so?”  he 
asked. 

“Of  course.  I  mean,  there 
is  a  reason  its  initials  are  VD. 
I  bet  you  more  people 
contract  syphilis  on 
Valentine’s  Day  than  on  any 
other  day  of  the  year.  What  a 


cause  for  celebration.” 

We  laughed  together,  and 
for  a  minute  it  felt  kind  of 
natural. 

“And  you?”  I  asked.  “Do 
you  have  plans  with  your 
girlfriend?” 

“Well,  we  did,”  he  said 
and  sighed.  “But  we  broke  up 
on  Saturday,  so  those  plans 
are  now  dead.” 

“Oh.  I’m  sorry.” 

But  I  wasn’t.  Inside,  I  felt 


kind  of  ecstatic  and 
overjoyed.  God,  I  was  such  a 
freaking  bitch. 

“Me,  too.”  There  was  a 
momentary  pause  on  the 
verge  of  being  awkward,  and 
then  he  said,  “I  think  we  have 
all  of  these  sorted.  Are  you 
ready  to  start  delivering?” 

“I’m  ready,  but  not  very 
willing.”  I  pointed  to  a  large 
vase  of  assorted  flowers. 
“Look  at  this.  I  would  wager 


money  that  some  girl  sent  this 
to  herself  so  that  she’d  look 
good  in  front  of  her  friends. 
How  sad  is  that?” 

“You’re  telling  me  you 
wouldn’t  do  it?”  Toby  asked, 
a  tiny  smirk  spreading  across 
his  boyish  face. 

“Never,”  I  said  flatly. 
“Who  cares  what  others  think 
of  me?  So  what  if  I  don’t  get 
a  present  on  Valentine’s  Day? 
It’s  just  vanity.  Who  do  I 


need  to  impress?” 

“I  don’t  know.  I  think 
Valentine’s  Day  is  more 
about  feeling  special,”  he 
said,  plucking  a  flower  from 
the  large  vase.  “I  think  every 
girl  deserves  to  feel  special 
once  in  a  while.  Even  you, 
Bianca.”  He  reached  over  and 
tucked  the  flower’s  stem 
behind  my  ear. 

I  tried  to  convince  myself 
that  this  was  completely 


cheesy  and  ridiculous.  That  if 
any  other  guy — Wesley  for 
example — had  tried  a  line 
like  that,  I  might  have 
slapped  him  or  just  laughed  in 
his  face.  But  I  felt  my  face 
turn  pink  as  his  fingers 
brushed  past  my  cheek.  This 
wasn’t  any  other  guy,  after 
all.  It  was  Toby  Tucker. 
Perfect,  amazing,  dreamy 
Toby  Tucker. 

Maybe  Valentine’s  Day 


could  be  Duff- friendly  after 
all. 

“Come  on,”  he  said. 

“Grab  that  pile  and  we’ll  start 
passing  these  out.” 

“Uh...  okay.” 

We  might  have  been  done 
delivering  by  the  end  of  first 
block,  but  the  secretary  kept 
bringing  more  and  more 
packages  to  the  little  vomit- 
colored  table.  It  became  very 
clear  to  Toby  and  me  that 


we’d  be  working  until  at  least 
lunch. 

Not  that  I  minded 
spending  the  morning  with 
Toby  Tucker. 

“I  don’t  want  to  jinx  it,” 
he  said  as  we  returned  to  the 
table,  only  five  minutes 
before  the  lunch  bell.  “But  I 
think  we  might  actually  be 
done.” 

We  reached  the  empty 
table  and  exchanged  smiles, 


though  mine  was  halfhearted. 
“That’s  it,”  I  said.  “That  was 
the  last  of  them.” 

“Yep.”  Toby  leaned 
against  the  table.  “You  know, 
I’m  glad  they  forced  you  to 
help.  I  would  have  been 
bored  out  of  my  mind  if  I’d 
done  this  by  myself.  It  was 
fun  talking  to  you.” 

“I  had  fun,  too,”  I  said, 
trying  not  to  sound  too 
enthusiastic. 


“Listen,”  he  said.  “You 
shouldn’t  sit  in  the  back  of 
the  room  in  AP  government. 
Why  don’t  you  take  one  of 
the  desks  behind  Jeanine  and 
me?  There’s  no  reason  for 
you  to  be  alone  back  there.  I 
think  you  should  join  us — the 
nerds  in  the  front  of  the 
room.” 

“I  might.”  And,  obviously, 
I  knew  I  would.  How  could  I 
refuse  such  a  request  from 


Toby  Tucker? 

“Bianca  Piper?”  The 
secretary  rounded  the  corner 
and  approached  us.  There 
were  no  flowers  or  candy 
boxes  in  her  hands  this  time. 
“Bianca,  there’s  someone 
here  to  sign  you  out.” 

“Oh,”  I  said.  “Urn,  okay.” 
Weird.  I  had  a  car.  There  was 
no  reason  for  me  to  be 
checked  out. 


“See  you  later,  Bianca,” 


Toby  called  as  I  followed  the 
secretary  toward  the  front 
desk.  “Happy  Valentine’s 
Day.” 

I  waved  just  before 
turning  the  corner,  trying  to 
remember  whether  or  not  I 
had  a  doctor’s  appointment 
that  day  or  something.  Why 
was  I  being  checked  out  of 
school?  But  before  my  mind 
could  invent  any  family 
tragedies,  the  answer  hit  me 


like  a  ton  of  bricks,  and  I 
stopped  dead  in  my  tracks. 

Oh.  My.  God. 

She  stood  at  the  front 
desk,  looking  like  she’d  just 
stepped  off  a  soundstage 
somewhere  in  Hollywood. 
Her  blond  hair,  lightened  by 
the  sun,  fell  around  her 
shoulders  in  gentle,  perfect 
waves.  She  wore  a  knee- 
length  teal  dress  (without 
panty  hose,  of  course)  and 


high  high  heels.  Dark 
sunglasses  covered  her  eyes 
— eyes  that  I  knew  were 
green.  She  lifted  the 
sunglasses  as  she  turned  to 
face  me. 

“Hi,  Bianca,”  the  beautiful 
woman  said. 

“Hi,  Mom.” 


14 


I  could  tell  she  was  nervous 
by  the  way  she  stepped 
toward  me.  She  looked  shaky, 
and  her  eyes  were  wide  with, 
from  what  I  could  guess,  fear. 
For  good  reason,  too.  Unlike 
my  father,  I  knew  she’d 
meant  to  send  those  divorce 


papers,  and  I  hated  her  for  it. 
For  not  warning  either  of  us. 
Sol  shot  her  a  warning  glare 
and  moved  away  when  she 
approached  me.  This  must 
have  confirmed  her  worries, 
because  her  glance  sank  to 
the  floor  and  she  focused  on 
the  toe  of  her  stiletto. 

“I’ve  missed  you, 
Bianca,”  my  mother  said. 

“Sure  you  have.” 

“Did  you  finish  signing 


her  out,  Mrs.  Piper?”  the 
secretary  asked,  returning  to 
her  chair  behind  the  tall  desk. 

“Yes,  I  did,”  Mom  said. 
Her  voice  found  its  smooth, 
natural  tone  again.  “So  are  we 
free  to  go,  warden?” 

“You’re  released,”  the 
secretary  laughed.  She  fluffed 
her  hair  and  added,  “And  I 
wanted  you  to  know,  I  bought 
a  copy  of  your  book.  It  has 
been  such  a  lifesaver  for  me.  I 


read  it  once  a  month.” 

Mom  smiled.  “Oh,  thank 
you!  Glad  to  meet  one  of  the 
ten  people  who’ve  actually 
read  it.” 

The  secretary  beamed  at 
her.  “It  changed  my  life.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes. 

Everyone  loved  my 
mother.  She  was  funny, 
intelligent,  and  gorgeous.  She 
looked  a  lot  like  Uma 
Thurman — as  far  from  being 


the  Duff  as  you  could 
possibly  get.  All  of  her  flaws 
were  hidden  behind  that 
pretty  face,  and  her  smile 
could  deceive  people  into 
believing  she  was  perfect. 

The  secretary,  who  giggled 
and  waved  as  Mom  led  me 
out  of  the  school,  was  just 
another  fool. 

“Where  exactly  are  we 
going?”  I  didn’t  bother  to 
shield  her  from  my  bitterness. 


She  deserved  it. 

“Um. . .  I  don’t  know,” 
Mom  admitted.  Her  heels 
clacked  on  the  smooth 
pavement  as  she  walked.  The 
sound  stopped  when  we 
reached  her  car,  a  red 
Mustang  that  looked  like  it 
had  been  lived  in  for  a  few 
days.  It  wasn’t  hard  to  tell 
she’d  driven  here  all  the  way 
from  Orange  County. 
“Somewhere  with  heat?”  She 


was  trying  to  sound  perky. 
“I’m  freezing  my  booty  off.” 

“If  you  put  some  decent 
clothes  on,  you  might  not 
have  that  problem.”  I  yanked 
open  the  passenger’s  side 
door  and  pushed  some  junk 
out  of  the  seat  before  sliding 
in.  “Sorry  this  isn’t 
California.  It  gets  cold  here.” 

“Oh,  California  isn’t  all 
it’s  cracked  up  to  be,”  Mom 
said.  She  looked  tense  as  she 


got  into  the  car,  and  her 
bubbly  laugh  was  clearly 
nervous,  not  humorous.  “It’s 
not  as  fun  as  the  movies  make 
it  look,  you  know?” 

“Really?  That’s  weird. 
You  seem  to  like  it  better 
than  Hamilton.  But  then 
again,  you  like  to  be 
anywhere  but  here,  don’t 
you?” 

The  laughter  died,  and  the 
car  became  silent.  Mom 


started  the  engine  and  pulled 
out  of  the  parking  lot.  Finally, 
with  all  of  her  veils  shredded, 
she  whispered,  “Bianca,  we 
have  to  talk  about  this.  I  don’t 
think  you  understand  what 
I’m  going  through  right 
now.” 

“Yeah,  it  looks  tough, 
Mom,”  I  snapped.  “Nice  tan, 
by  the  way.  I  know  Orange 
County  must  have  been  a  real 
hellhole.  How  did  you 


manage?” 

“Bianca  Lynne  Piper,  I 
won’t  take  that  attitude  from 
you!”  she  shouted.  “Despite 
what  you  think  of  me  right 
now,  I  am  still  your  mother, 
and  I  deserve  a  certain 
amount  of  respect.” 

“Really?”  I  snorted.  “Like 
the  respect  you  showed  Dad 
by  sending  fucking  divorce 
papers  without  warning  him? 
Or  me!  For  God’s  sake, 


Mother,  what  the  hell  is  the 
matter  with  you?” 

More  silence. 

I  knew  this  would  get  us 
nowhere.  I  knew  I  should 
listen  to  her,  consider  her 
side,  and  share  my  feelings 
reasonably.  I’d  seen  enough 
Dr.  Phil  to  know  we  needed 
to  compromise,  but  I  didn’t 
want  to.  Selfish,  childish, 
immature. . .  I  might  have 
been  all  of  those  things,  but 


my  father’s  face,  the  empty 
beer  bottles  I’d  picked  up  last 
week,  and  the  stupid  divorce 
papers  just  kept  popping  into 
my  mind.  Listen?  Consider? 
Be  reasonable?  How  were 
those  even  options?  She  was 
just  as  childish  and  selfish  as 
me.  The  only  difference  was 
that  she  hid  it  better. 

Mom  let  out  a  slow  breath 
before  pulling  the  car  over  to 
the  side  of  the  road.  She  shut 


off  the  engine  without  saying 
a  word,  and  I  stared  out  my 
window  at  an  empty  field, 
which  would  be  full  of  high 
cornstalks  when  summer 
finally  showed  up.  The  gray 
February  sky  said  everything. 
Cold.  Bleak.  A  wasted  day.  A 
wasted  effort.  But  I  wouldn’t 
speak  first.  I  would  let  her  be 
the  adult  for  once  in  her  life. 

Seconds  ticked  by.  The 
only  sound  in  the  car  was  our 


breathing.  Mom  gave  short, 
hesitant  gasps,  as  if  she  were 
on  the  verge  of  speaking  but 
changed  her  mind  before  the 
first  word  could  escape  her 
lips.  I  waited. 

“Bianca,”  she  said 
eventually.  We’d  been  quiet 
for  at  least  five  minutes. 
“I’m....  I’m  sorry.  I’m  so... 
so  sorry.” 

I  didn’t  say  anything. 

“I  didn’t  want  it  to  end 


like  this.”  The  way  her  voice 
cracked  made  me  wonder  if 
she  was  crying,  but  I  didn’t 
turn  my  head.  “I  haven’t  been 
happy  for  a  long  time,  and 
after  your  grandma  died,  your 
dad  suggested  I  take  a  trip.  I 
thought  it  might  help.  Like 
I’d  escape  for  a  little  while, 
give  a  few  speeches  in 
different  towns,  then  come 
back  and  everything  would  be 
better.  Go  back  to  how  it  used 


to  be  when  your  dad  and  I 
first  got  married.  But. . .” 

Her  long,  thin  fingers 
trembled  as  they  closed 
around  my  hand.  Reluctantly, 
I  faced  her.  There  were  no 
tears  on  her  cheeks,  but  I 
could  see  a  misty  glitter  in 
her  eyes.  The  dam  just  hadn’t 
broken  yet. 

“But  I  was  wrong,”  she 
said.  “I  thought  I  could 
escape  from  my  problems, 


but  I  was  so  wrong,  Bianca. 
No  matter  where  you  go  or 
what  you  do  to  distract 
yourself,  reality  catches  up 
with  you  eventually.  I  came 
home,  and  after  a  few  days,  I 
felt  it  again,  so  I’d  leave  on 
another  trip.  I’d  stay  away  a 
little  longer,  book  a  few  more 
places  to  speak,  go  a  little 
farther  away. . .  until  I 
couldn’t  go  any  farther  at  all. 
It  caught  up  with  me  on  the 


other  side  of  the  country,  and 
I...  I  had  to  face  it.” 

“Face  what?” 

“That  I  don’t  want  to  be 
with  your  dad  anymore.”  She 
looked  down  at  our  hands, 
still  twined  together.  “I  love 
your  dad  very  much,  but  I’m 
not  in  love  with  him. . .  not 
the  way  he’s  in  love  with  me. 
That’s  cliche  as  heck,  but  it’s 
true.  I  can’t  keep  lying  and 
pretending  things  are  okay 


with  us.  I’m  sorry.” 

“So  you  want  a  divorce?” 

“Yes.” 

I  sighed  and  looked  out 
the  window  again.  Still  gray. 
Still  cold. 

“You’ll  have  to  tell  Dad,” 
I  said.  “He  thinks  it  was  a 
mistake.  He  doesn’t  think 
you. . .  you  could  ever  do  that 
to  us.” 

“Do  you  hate  me?” 

“No.” 


The  answer  didn’t  really 
surprise  me,  even  though  the 
word  just  kind  of  flew  out 
automatically.  I  wanted  to 
hate  her.  Not  so  much  for  the 
divorce;  as  much  as  she’d 
been  gone  for  the  past  few 
years,  the  idea  of  living  with 
a  single  parent  wasn’t  all  that 
new  or  upsetting.  And 
honestly,  I’d  been  expecting 
them  to  separate  for  a  while. 
Really,  I’d  wanted  to  hate  her 


for  Dad.  For  the  pain  I  knew 
she  was  causing  him.  For  that 
night  he’d  relapsed. 

But  it  hit  me  then.  She 
didn’t  cause  that  relapse.  I 
could  blame  her  all  I  wanted, 
but  that  wouldn’t  do  any 
good.  She  had  to  take 
responsibility  for  her  own 
life,  and  Dad  had  to  do  the 
same.  By  staying  married, 
letting  things  go  on  the  way 
they  had  for  the  past  three 


years,  they’d  both  be  living  in 
denial. 

My  mother  was  finally 
facing  reality.  Dad  would 
have  to  face  it,  too. 

“I  don’t  hate  you,  Mom.” 

The  sky  had  been  black  for 
hours  by  the  time  Mom 
dropped  me  off  in  the  high 
school  parking  lot,  where 
we’d  left  my  car.  We’d  spent 
the  afternoon  just  driving 


around  Hamilton  and  talking 
about  all  that  she’d  missed. 
The  same  way  we  did  every 
time  she  came  back  from  a 
tour.  Only  this  time,  she 
wouldn’t  be  coming  home.  At 
least  not  to  stay. 

“I’m  gonna  go  see  your 
dad  now. . .  I  guess,”  Mom 
said.  “Maybe  you  should 
spend  the  night  with  Casey, 
honey.  I  just  don’t  know  how 
he’ll  react....  That’s  a  lie.  I 


do  know  how  he’ll  react,  and 
it  won’t  be  good.” 

I  nodded,  hoping  she  was 
wrong — though  our 
definitions  of  not  good  were 
different.  I  hadn’t  mentioned 
his  relapse  to  her,  mostly 
since  it  had  passed  without 
any  significant  drama.  She 
was  afraid  of  tears  and  yelling 
— the  things  that  should  be 
expected  with  a  confrontation 
of  this  kind.  I  didn’t  want  to 


make  her  worry  about  the 
drinking,  too.  Especially 
since  it  hadn’t  really  been  that 
big  a  deal  in  the  end. 

“God,”  she  whispered.  “I 
feel  horrible.  I’m  telling  my 
husband  I  want  a  divorce  on 
Valentine’s  Day.  I’m  such 
a. . .  a  bitch.  Maybe  I  should 
wait  until  tomorrow  and — ” 

“You  have  to  tell  him, 
Mom.  If  you  put  it  off  now, 
you’ll  never  do  it.”  I 


unfastened  my  seat  belt.  “I’ll 
call  Casey  and  see  if  I  can 
stay  with  her.  You  should  go 
now. . .  before  it  gets  too 
late.” 

“Okay.”  She  took  a  deep 
breath  and  let  it  out  slowly. 
“Okay,  I  will.” 

I  opened  the  door  of  the 
Mustang  and  climbed  out. 
“It’ll  be  fine.” 

Mom  shook  her  head  and 
fiddled  with  the  keys 


dangling  from  the  ignition. 
“You  shouldn’t  have  to  be  the 
grown-up,”  she  murmured. 
“I’m  the  mother.  I  should  be 
comforting  you,  telling  you  it 
will  be  okay.  This  is  so 
dysfunctional.” 

“Functionality  is 
overrated.”  I  gave  her  a 
reassuring  smile.  “I’ll  talk  to 
you  tomorrow,  Mom.  Good 
luck.” 

“Thanks,”  she  sighed.  “I 


love  you,  Bianca.” 

“You,  too.” 

“Bye,  baby.” 

I  shut  the  door  and 
stepped  away  from  the  car. 
With  my  smile  still  firmly 
intact,  I  waved  and  watched 
as  the  little  red  Mustang 
drifted  out  of  the  parking  lot 
and  turned  onto  the  highway, 
where  it  hesitated  as  if 
debating  whether  or  not  to 
proceed.  But  my  mother 


drove  on.  So  I  kept  waving. 

As  soon  as  the  taillights 
vanished,  I  allowed  the  smile 
to  slip  from  my  face.  Yes,  I 
knew  things  would  be  okay. 
Yes,  I  knew  Mom  was  doing 
the  right  thing.  Yes,  I  knew 
this  was  a  step  in  the  right 
direction  for  both  my  parents. 
But  I  knew  Dad  wouldn’t  see 
it  that  way. . .  at  least  not  at 
first.  I’d  smiled  to  reassure 
Mom,  but  for  Dad  I  hung  my 


head. 

I  pulled  the  car  keys  out  of 
my  back  pocket  and  unlocked 
the  door.  After  throwing  my 
stuff  onto  the  passenger’s 
seat,  I  climbed  inside  and 
shut  the  door,  putting  a  wall 
between  my  already  shaking 
body  and  the  February  night. 
For  several  minutes,  I  just  sat 
in  the  silent  car,  trying  not  to 
think  or  worry  about  my 
parents. 


That  was  impossible,  of 
course. 

I  reached  a  hand  into  my 
purse  and  began  sifting 
through  the  clutter  of  gum 
wrappers  and  pens.  Finally,  I 
located  my  cell  phone.  I 
pulled  it  out  and  paused  with 
my  thumb  poised  over  the 
keypad. 

I  didn’t  call  Casey. 

I  waited  through  three 
rings  before  I  got  an  answer. 


“Hey.  It’s  Bianca.  Um,  are 
you  still  busy?” 

“Are  you  kidding  me?” 

I  gawked  at  the  giant  flat- 
screen,  feeling  my  face  get 
hot.  Again?  Seriously?  That 
was  the  tenth  time  in  a  row 
Wesley  had  beaten  me  since 
I’d  arrived  an  hour  earlier.  I’d 
half  expected  to  find  some 
leggy  blonde  sneaking  out  of 
his  bedroom  when  I  walked 


up  the  steps,  but  the  scene  I 
found  was  quite  different. 
Wesley  was  playing 
Soulcalibur  IV.  And  because 
I’m  a  glutton  for  punishment, 
I’d  challenged  him. 

My  God,  I  had  to  find 
something  I  could  beat  him 
at! 

And  you  know,  something 
about  beating  the  shit  out  of 
an  animated  character  really 
made  me  feel  better.  Before  I 


knew  it,  I  wasn’t  even 
worried  about  Mom  or  Dad. 
Things  would  be  okay.  They 
had  to  be.  I  just  had  to  be 
patient  and  let  things  happen. 
And  in  the  meantime,  I  had  to 
kick  Wesley’s  ass. . .  or  try,  at 
least. 

“I  told  you,  I’m  awesome 
at  everything,”  he  teased, 
putting  the  PS 3  controller  on 
the  floor  between  us.  “That 
includes  video  games.” 


I  watched  as  the  character 
Wesley  had  been  operating 
moved  across  the  screen, 
doing  some  sort  of  odd 
victory  dance.  “Not  fair,”  I 
muttered.  “Your  sword  was 
bigger  than  mine.” 

“My  sword  is  bigger  than 
everyone’s.” 

I  lobbed  my  controller  at 
his  head,  but  of  course  he 
ducked  and  made  me  miss. 
Damn  it.  “Perv.” 


“Oh,  come  on,”  he 
laughed.  “You  walked  right 
into  that  one,  Duffy.” 

I  scowled  at  him  for  a 
moment,  but  I  could  feel  the 
aggravation  slipping  away. 
Finally,  I  just  shook  my 
head...  and  smiled.  “Okay, 
you’re  right.  I  did  leave  that 
one  wide  open.  But  you 
know,  boys  that  talk  big 
never  are.” 

Wesley  frowned.  “We 


both  know  that  isn’t  true.  I’ve 
proved  it  to  you  plenty  of 
times.”  He  smirked,  then 
leaned  against  me,  letting  his 
lips  brush  against  my  ear. 
“But  I  can  prove  it  again  if 
you  want  me  to. . .  and  you 
know  you  want  me  to.” 

“I. . .  I  don’t  think  that’s 
necessary,”  I  managed.  His 
lips  were  moving  down  my 
neck,  sending  an  electric 
current  up  my  spine. 


“Oh,”  he  growled 
playfully.  “I  do.” 

I  laughed  as  he  shoved  me 
to  the  floor,  one  of  his  hands 
perfectly  catching  the  space 
above  my  left  hip  where  I 
was  most  ticklish.  He’d 
discovered  that  spot  a  couple 
of  weeks  ago,  and  I  was 
furious  with  myself  for  letting 
him  use  it  against  me.  Now 
he  could  make  me  squirm  and 
laugh  uncontrollably 


whenever  he  wanted,  and  I 
could  tell  that  he  totally  got 
off  on  it.  Jerk. 

His  fingers  probed  the 
sensitive  spot  over  my  hip  as 
his  mouth  moved  from  my 
collarbone  to  my  ear.  I  was 
laughing  so  hard  I  could 
barely  breathe.  Not  fair.  So 
not  fair.  I  made  a  halfhearted 
attempt  to  kick  him  away,  but 
he  trapped  my  leg  between 
his  and  proceeded  to  tickle 


me  harder. 

Just  when  I  thought  I 
might  pass  out  from  lack  of 
oxygen,  I  felt  something 
vibrate  in  my  back  pocket. 
“Stop,  stop!”  I  cried,  shoving 
Wesley  away.  He  rolled  off 
me,  and  I  stumbled  to  my 
feet,  trying  to  catch  my 
breath,  and  took  my  phone 
out  of  my  pocket.  I  expected 
it  to  be  Mom,  letting  me 
know  how  things  had  gone 


with  Dad — putting  any 
worries  I  might  still  have  at 
ease — but  when  I  glanced  at 
the  ID,  my  stomach  lurched. 

“Oh,  shit.  Casey.”  I 
looked  down  at  Wesley,  still 
lying  on  the  floor,  his  hands 
tucked  behind  his  head.  His 
T-shirt  had  ridden  up  a  little, 
and  I  could  just  make  out  his 
hip  bones,  peeking  out 
beneath  the  green  fabric. 
“Don’t  say  anything,”  I  told 


him.  “She  cannot  know  I’m 
here.”  I  flipped  open  the 
phone  then  and  said,  as 
smoothly  as  I  could,  “Hello?” 

“Hey.”  She  sounded 
pissed.  “What  the  hell 
happened  to  you  tonight?  Jess 
said  the  three  of  us  were 
meeting  for  Valentine’s  Day, 
but  you  never  showed.” 

“Sorry,”  I  said. 
“Something  came  up.” 

“Bianca,  you’ve  been 


saying  that  a  lot  lately. 
Something  is  always  coming 
up  or  you  have  plans  or. . .” 

Suddenly,  I  felt  Wesley’s 
breath  hit  the  back  of  my 
neck.  He’d  gotten  up  from  the 
floor  and  slid  up  behind  me 
without  me  realizing  it.  His 
arms  slid  around  my  waist 
from  behind,  his  fingers 
undoing  the  button  of  my 
jeans  before  I  could  stop  him. 

“...  and  Jess  had  her 


hopes  up  that  we’d  do 
something  fun...” 

I  couldn’t  focus  on  a  word 
Casey  was  saying  as 
Wesley’s  hand  slid  beneath 
the  waistband  of  my  pants, 
his  fingers  moving  lower  and 
lower. 

I  couldn’t  say  a  word.  I 
couldn’t  tell  him  to  stop  or 
show  any  reaction  at  all.  If  I 
did,  Casey  would  know  I 
wasn’t  alone.  But,  God,  I 


could  feel  my  whole  body 
turning  into  a  ball  of  fire. 
Wesley  was  laughing  against 
my  neck,  knowing  he  was 
driving  me  crazy. 

. .  I  just  don’t  understand 
what’s  up  with  you.” 

I  bit  my  lip  to  keep  from 
gasping  as  Wesley’s  fingers 
slipped  to  places  that  made 
my  knees  shake.  I  could  feel 
the  smirk  on  his  lips  as  they 
moved  to  my  ear.  Asshole. 


He  was  trying  to  torture  me.  I 
couldn’t  handle  it  much 
longer. 

“Bianca,  are  you  there?” 

Wesley  bit  my  earlobe  and 
pushed  my  jeans  even  lower 
with  his  free  hand  as  the  other 
continued  to  make  me  shiver. 

“Casey,  I  have  to  go.” 

“What?  B,  I—” 

I  snapped  the  phone  shut 
and  dropped  it  on  the  floor.  I 
pushed  Wesley’s  arms  away 


from  me  and  spun  around  to 
face  him.  Sure  enough,  he 
was  grinning. 

“You  son  of  a — ” 

“Hey,”  he  said,  raising  his 
hands  in  surrender.  “You  said 
not  to  say  anything.  You 
didn’t  say  I  couldn’t — ” 

I  dove  for  my  abandoned 
video  game  controller  and 
clicked  the  button  that  would 
restart  the  match,  determined 
to  teach  him  a  lesson  for 


messing  with  me  like  that.  I’d 
already  gotten  in  a  few  good 
blows  before  Wesley  was 
able  to  retrieve  his  own 
controller  and  fight  back. 

“And  you  accuse  me  of 
being  a  cheater,”  he  said, 
blocking  the  punch  my 
gladiator  girl  threw  at  him. 

“Well,  you  deserve  it,”  I 
snapped,  furiously  tapping 
attack  buttons. 

It  didn’t  matter.  Even  with 


my  dramatic  head  start,  he 
still  beat  me.  Damn  it. 

“Happy  Valentine’s  Day, 
Duffy.”  Wesley  turned  to  grin 
at  me,  his  gray  eyes  sparkling 
with  cocky  triumph. 

Why  did  he  have  to  say 
that?  I  wondered  as  my 
thoughts  drifted  back  to  my 
parents.  Had  Mom  broken  the 
news  to  Dad  yet?  Were  they 
fighting?  Or  crying? 

“Bianca.” 


I  realized  I’d  been  biting 
my  lip  a  little  too  hard  as  the 
metallic  taste  of  blood 
touched  the  tip  of  my  tongue. 

I  blinked  at  Wesley,  who  was 
watching  me  closely.  He 
stared  at  me  for  a  long 
moment,  but  instead  of  asking 
me  what  was  wrong  or  if  I’d 
be  okay,  he  picked  up  his 
controller  again.  “Come  on,” 
he  said.  “I’ll  take  it  easy  on 
you  this  time.” 


I  forced  a  smile. 
Everything  would  work  itself 
out.  It  had  to.  “Don’t  be 
stupid,”  I  told  Wesley.  “I’m 
going  to  kick  your  ass  this 
time.  I’ve  just  been  holding 
back.” 

He  laughed,  knowing  I 
was  full  of  shit.  “We’ll  see 
about  that.” 

And  we  started  another 
game. 


15 


I’d  never  heard  anything  so 
freaking  loud  in  my  life.  It 
sounded  like  a  bomb  was 
going  off  right  next  to  my 
ear. . .  a  bomb  that  pulsed  to 
the  beat  of  Michael  Jackson’s 
“Thriller.”  Groggily  I  rolled 
over  and  picked  my  vibrating 


cell  phone  up  off  the 
nightstand,  glancing  at  the 
time  before  I  answered. 

Five  o’clock  in  the 
morning. 

“Hello?”  I  groaned. 

“Sorry  to  wake  you  up, 
honey,”  Mom  said  through 
the  speaker.  “I  didn’t  wake 
Casey  up  too,  did  I?” 

“Mm-mm.  You’re  fine. 
What’s  up?” 

“I  left  the  house  about  two 


hours  ago,”  she  said.  “Your 
dad  and  I  had  a  long  talk, 
but. . .  he  didn’t  handle  it  very 
well,  Bianca.  I  knew  he 
wouldn’t.  Anyway,  I’ve  just 
been  driving  around  since 
then,  trying  to  figure  out  what 
to  do  next.  I’ve  decided  to 
check  into  a  hotel  in  Oak  Hill 
for  a  few  days  so  that  I  can 
spend  more  time  with  you, 
and  this  weekend  I’m  gonna 
start  moving  down  to 


Tennessee.  Your  granddad 
needs  someone  to  look  after 
him.  It’ll  be  a  nice  place  to 
settle  down.  Don’t  you 
think?” 

“Sure,”  I  murmured. 

“I’m  sorry,”  Mom  said.  “I 
should  have  told  you  all  this 
later.  Go  back  to  sleep.  Call 
me  when  you  get  out  of 
school,  and  I’ll  tell  you  which 
hotel  I’m  in.  Maybe  we  can 
go  see  a  movie  tonight?” 


“Sounds  good.  Bye, 
Mom.” 

“Bye,  baby.” 

I  put  my  phone  back  on 
the  nightstand  and  stretched 
my  arms  over  my  head, 
stifling  a  yawn.  This  bed, 
with  its  cushy  mattress  and 
expensive  sheets,  was  way 
too  damn  comfortable.  I’d 
never  had  such  a  hard  time 
getting  up  in  the  morning,  but 
I  managed  to  plant  my  feet  on 


the  carpet  eventually. 

“Where  are  you  going?” 
Wesley  asked  in  a  semi- 
sleepy  voice. 

“Home.”  I  pulled  on  my 
jeans.  “I’ve  gotta  take  a 
shower  and  get  ready  for 
school.” 

He  pushed  himself  up  on 
one  elbow  to  look  at  me.  His 
hair  was  a  mess,  brown  curls 
falling  into  his  eyes  and 
sticking  up  in  the  back.  “You 


can  shower  here,”  he  offered. 
“I  might  even  join  you  if 
you’re  lucky.” 

“No,  thanks.”  I  grabbed 
my  jacket  off  the  floor  and 
slung  it  over  my  shoulders. 
“Will  I  wake  your  parents  up 
if  I  go  out  the  front  door?” 

“That  would  be  difficult 
considering  they’re  not  here.” 

“They  didn’t  come  home 
last  night?” 

“They  won’t  be  home  for 


a  week,”  Wesley  said.  “And 
God  knows  how  long  they’ll 
stay  then.  A  day.  Maybe 
two.” 

Now  that  I  thought  about 
it,  I’d  never  seen  another  car 
in  the  almost-mansion’s 
driveway.  Wesley  always 
seemed  to  be  the  only  one 
here  when  I  came  over — 
which  was  pretty  freaking 
often  these  days.  “Where  are 
they?” 


“I  don’t  remember.”  He 
shrugged  and  rolled  onto  his 
back  again.  “Business  trip. 
Caribbean  vacation.  I  can 
never  keep  up  with  them.” 

“What  about  your  sister?” 

“Amy  stays  with  our 
grandmother  when  my 
parents  are  out  of  town,”  he 
said.  “Which  is  essentially  all 
the  time.” 

Slowly  I  moved  back  to 
the  bed.  “So,”  I  said  quietly, 


sitting  on  the  edge  of  the 
mattress.  “Why  don’t  you 
stay  there,  too?  I  bet  your 
sister  would  like  having  you 
around.” 

“She  might,”  Wesley 
agreed.  “My  grandmother, 
however,  is  a  different  story. 
She  detests  me.  She  doesn’t 
approve  of  my” — he  made  air 
quotes — “ lifestyle . 

Apparently  I’m  a  disgrace  to 
the  Rush  name,  and  my  father 


ought  to  be  ashamed  of  me.” 
His  laugh  was  hollow  and 
cold.  “Because  he  and  my 
mother  are  the  staple  of 
perfection,  you  know.” 

“How  does  your 
grandmother  know  about 
your,  uh,  lifestyle?” 

“She  hears  the  gossip 
from  her  friends.  Old  hags 
hear  their  granddaughters 
swooning  over  me — and  who 
can  blame  them? — and  then 


they  tell  my  grandmother  all 
about  it.  She  might  actually 
like  me  if  I’d  date  a  girl 
seriously  for  a  while,  but  part 
of  me  just  doesn’t  want  to 
give  her  the  satisfaction.  I 
shouldn’t  have  to  change  my 
life  to  suit  her  or  anyone 
else.” 

“I  understand  what  you 
mean.”  And  I  did.  Because 
I’d  had  that  same  thought  a 
million  times  over  the  years. 


Recently,  it  had  even 
pertained  to  him.  It  would  be 
easy  to  change  Wesley’s 
opinion  of  me,  to  hang  out 
with  different  people  or  bring 
another  girl  into  my  circle  of 
friends — like  that  freshman 
from  the  basketball  game — to 
avoid  being  the  Duff.  But 
why  should  I  do  anything  just 
to  fix  what  he  or  anyone  else 
thought  about  me?  I  shouldn’t 
have  to. 


And  neither  should  he. 

Somehow,  though,  his 
situation  felt  different.  I 
glanced  around  the  room, 
feeling  stupid  for  even 
comparing  it  to  the  Duff 
issue.  Then,  without  meaning 
to,  I  found  myself  asking, 
“But  don’t  you  get  lonely?  In 
this  big  house  by  yourself.” 

Oh  my  God.  Was  I 
actually  feeling  sorry  for 
Wesley?  Wesley  the 


womanizer?  Filthy-rich 
Wesley?  Wesley  the  jackass? 
Of  all  the  emotions  I’d  felt 
for  him,  sympathy  had  never 
come  up.  What  the  hell  was 
going  on? 

But  if  there  was  anything  I 
could  relate  to,  it  was  family 
drama.  So  it  seemed  like 
Wesley  and  I  had  some  stuff 
in  common.  Ugh. 

“You  forget  how  rarely 
I’m  alone.”  He  pushed 


himself  into  a  sitting  position 
and  looked  at  me  with  a 
smirk.  It  didn’t  touch  his 
eyes,  though.  “You  aren’t  the 
only  one  who  finds  me 
irresistible,  Duffy.  I  usually 
have  an  endless  flow  of 
attractive  houseguests.” 

I  bit  my  lip,  not  sure  if  I 
should  say  what  was  on  my 
mind.  Finally,  I  decided  I 
might  as  well  throw  it  out 
there.  It  wouldn’t  do  any 


harm,  after  all.  “Listen, 
Wesley,  this  may  sound  weird 
coming  from  me,  since  I  hate 
you  and  all,  but  you  can  tell 
me  stuff  if  you  want.”  It 
sounded  like  something  out 
of  a  cheesy  G-rated  movie. 
Great.  “I  mean,  I  vented  all  of 
my  shit  about  Jake  to  you,  so 
if  you  want  to  do  the  same,. . . 
well,  I’m  cool  with  that.” 

The  smirk  slipped  for  a 
second.  “I ’ll  keep  that  in 


mind.”  Then  he  cleared  his 
throat  and  added  stiffly, 
“Didn’t  you  say  that  you 
needed  to  go  home?  Y ou 
don’t  want  to  be  late  for 
school.” 

“Right.” 

I  started  to  stand,  but  his 
warm  hand  closed  around  my 
wrist.  I  turned  around  and 
found  him  looking  at  me.  He 
leaned  forward  and  pressed 
his  lips  against  mine.  Before  I 


even  realized  what  was 
happening,  he  pulled  away 
and  whispered,  “Thank  you, 
Bianca.” 

“Um. . .  no  problem.” 

I  didn’t  know  what  to 
make  of  it.  Every  other  time 
Wesley  and  I  had  kissed,  it 
had  been  a  fierce,  warlike 
make-out.  A  lead-in  to  sex. 
He’d  never  kissed  me  in  such 
a  gentle,  greedless  way,  and  it 
kind  of  freaked  me  out. 


But  I  didn’t  have  time  to 
think  about  it  as  I  ran  down 
the  stairs  and  through  the 
foyer.  Once  I  was  in  my  car,  I 
had  to  speed — which  I  really, 
really  hate  to  do — all  the  way 
to  my  house,  and  I  still  didn’t 
get  there  before  six.  That 
gave  me  only  an  hour  and  a 
half  to  shower,  get  dressed, 
and  check  on  Dad.  What  a 
fantastic  way  to  start  the 
morning. 


Even  better  was  the  fact 
that  I  could  tell  the  living 
room  lights  were  on  when  I 
pulled  into  my  driveway.  Not 
a  good  sign.  Dad  always — 
always —  turned  out  every 
light  in  the  house  before  bed. 
He  treated  it  like  a  ritual.  The 
fact  that  he’d  left  them  on 
was  definitely  a  bad  omen. 

I  heard  the  snoring  as  soon 
as  I  tiptoed  inside  and 
instantly  knew  he’d  bought 


more  beer.  Even  before  I  saw 
the  bottles  on  the  coffee  table 
or  his  unconscious  form  on 
the  couch,  I  knew. 

He’d  gotten  drunk  enough 
to  pass  out. 

I  started  to  move  forward 
but  stopped  myself.  As  much 
as  I  might  want  to,  I  didn’t 
have  time  to  clean  up  Dad’s 
mess.  I  needed  to  go  upstairs. 
I  needed  to  go  to  school.  And 
as  I  crept  up  to  my  bedroom, 


I  told  myself  that  he  would  be 
fine.  He  was  just  shocked,  it 
would  be  fine,  and  this. . . 
episode  would  pass  without 
incident.  I  could  hardly  hold  a 
few  drinks  against  the  guy, 
considering  the  bombshell 
Mom  dropped  on  him,  could 
I? 

I  took  a  quick  shower  and 
blow-dried  my  hair  (which 
always  takes  forever; 
seriously,  maybe  I  should  just 


hack  all  my  hair  off  like 
Casey  instead  of  wasting  my 
time)  before  putting  on  some 
fresh  clothes.  After  I  brushed 
my  teeth,  I  headed  downstairs 
again  and  went  into  the 
kitchen  to  grab  a  Pop-Tart  for 
the  road.  Then  I  took  off,  out 
the  front  door. 

By  the  time  I  got  to 
school,  the  student  parking  lot 
was  almost  full.  I  had  to  park 
in  the  very  back  row  and  jog 


— with  my  twenty-pound 
backpack — to  the  double 
doors.  Of  course  that  left  me 
out  of  breath  by  the  time  I 
made  it  into  the  main 
hallway.  God,  I  thought 
miserably  as  I  lugged  my  fat 
ass  toward  Spanish,  no 
wonder  I’m  the  Duff.  I’m  so 
fucking  out  of  shape  it ’s 
depressing. 

Well,  at  least  the  halls 
were  pretty  much  empty.  That 


meant  no  one  had  to  witness 
my  patheticness. 

“Hey,  where ’d  you  go 
yesterday?”  Jessica  asked 
when  I  slumped  into  my  desk 
only  seconds  before  the  bell 
rang.  “You  weren’t  at  lunch 
or  in  English.  Casey  and  I 
were  kind  of  worried.” 

“I  left  school  early.” 

“I  thought  the  three  of  us 
were  gonna  have  a 
Valentine’s  Day  thing  to 


celebrate  that  we’re  all 
single.” 

“That’s  kind  of  ironic, 
don’t  you  think?”  I  sighed 
and  shook  my  head,  trying 
not  to  look  into  her  big,  hurt 
eyes.  God,  she  was  good  at 
making  me  feel  guilty.  And  I 
knew  I  was  going  to  pay  for 
hanging  up  on  Casey  last 
night.  “Sorry,  Jessica. 
Something  came  up 
yesterday.  I’ll  tell  you  about 


it  after  school,  okay?” 

Before  she  could  say 
anything,  Mrs.  Romali 
cleared  her  throat  and 
shouted,  “ Silencio !  Buenos 
dias,  amigos.  Today  we’re 
going  to  get  started  on  the 
present  progressive  tense,  and 
I’ll  warn  you  now  that  it’s 
pretty  darn  difficult.” 

And  it  was.  Mrs.  Romali 
passed  out  a  worksheet  that 
kept  us  all  busy  until  the  end 


of  the  block.  By  the  time  the 
bell  rang,  I  was  really  starting 
to  question  my  affection  for 
Spanish  class,  and  I  wasn’t 
alone. 

“Is  it  too  late  to  switch 
classes  for  the  semester?” 
Angela  asked  Jessica  and  me 
when  we  walked  out  of  the 
classroom. 

“About  a  month  too  late,” 
I  told  her. 

“Damn  it.” 


“Bye,  Bianca!”  Jessica 
called  as  they  ran  toward  their 
chemistry  class.  “See  you  at 
lunch!” 

I  waved  and  started 
walking  down  the  other 
hallway.  Today,  though,  I 
was  actually  looking  forward 
to  AP  government.  Toby 
Tucker  had  asked  me  to  sit 
near  him.  I  wouldn’t  be  the 
lonely  girl  in  the  back  of  the 
room  anymore.  I’d  never 


thought  that  would  change  or 
that  I  would  be  so  happy 
when  it  did.  What  can  I  say? 
The  self-imposed  isolation 
was  finally  beginning  to  bug 
me. 

But  Toby  wasn’t  there. 

His  seat  was  completely,  one 
hundred  percent  empty  when 
I  walked  into  the  classroom 
(for  once  I  was  way  early,  the 
way  Mr.  Chaucer  liked),  and 
my  heart  kind  of  sank  a  little 


bit. . .  or,  you  know,  a  lot.  At 
least  I  didn’t  have  to  sit  alone. 
Jeanine  practically  dragged 
me  to  the  front  of  the  room, 
apparently  lost  without  Toby 
to  keep  her  entertained.  She 
must  have  been  disappointed 
that  I  wasn’t  nearly  as  clever 
with  political  quips  as  her 
usual  companion.  All  I  could 
offer  were  a  few  sarcastic 
statements  about  the 
usefulness  of  the  judicial 


system.  God,  I  missed  Toby. 

So  did  Mr.  Chaucer.  He 
seemed  to  get  bored  with  his 
own  uninterrupted  lecture, 
and  he  dismissed  the  class 
only  halfheartedly  when  the 
bell  rang,  his  lower  lip 
sticking  out  like  a  toddler’s. 

And  they  say  teachers 
don’t  play  favorites. 

I  was  relieved  to  be  out  of 
that  classroom,  which  seemed 
cold  without  Toby’s 


enlightening  commentaries, 
until  I  got  into  the  cafeteria. 

The  lunch  table  wasn’t 
exactly  a  warm,  loving 
environment  that  afternoon. 
Casey  glared  at  me  all 
through  lunch,  obviously 
pissed  that  I’d  hung  up  on  her 
the  night  before.  But 
apparently  not  pissed  enough 
to  skip  out  on  meeting  Jessica 
and  me  after  school  to  hear 


my  excuses. 


I’d  promised  to  explain 
things  after  class.  Of  course, 
that  meant  the  second  the  last 
bell  sounded,  they  dragged 
me  into  an  empty  bathroom 
and  started  making  demands 
like  “Spill!”  and  “Out  with 
it!”  before  I  could  take  a 
single  freaking  breath. 

I  groaned  and  slid  down 
the  cold  concrete  wall  to  land 
in  a  sitting  position  on  the 
floor.  I  hugged  my  knees 


loosely  and  said,  “Okay, 
okay.  So  Mom  showed  up 
here  yesterday  afternoon.” 

“Is  she  back  from  her 
trip?”  Jessica  asked. 

“Not  exactly.  She  just 
came  to  talk  to  me.  She  and 
Dad  are  getting  a  divorce.” 

Jessica  clapped  a  hand 
over  her  mouth  in  shock,  and 
Casey  knelt  down  beside  me, 
taking  my  hand.  “You  okay, 
B?”  she  asked,  abandoning 


her  anger  toward  me. 

“I’m  fine,”  I  said.  I  knew 
they’d  be  more  upset  about  it 
than  I  was.  Casey,  whose 
parents  had  gone  through  a 
long,  bitter  divorce,  and 
Jessica,  who  could  never 
imagine  something  so 
upsetting  and  unhappy. 

“Is  that  why  you  skipped 
out  on  Valentine’s  Day  last 
night?”  Jessica  asked. 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “Sorry.  I 


just. . .  didn’t  really  feel  like 
celebrating.” 

“You  should  have  called,” 
Casey  said.  “Or  said 
something  to  me  on  the  phone 
last  night.  I  would  have 
listened,  you  know.” 

“I  know.  But  really,  I’m 
fine.  It  was  just  a  matter  of 
time.  I’ve  been  expecting  it 
for  a  while  now.”  I  shrugged. 
“And,  honestly,  it  doesn’t 
really  bother  me.  I  mean,  you 


know  Mom  hasn’t  been 
around  much  in  the  past  few 
years,  so  it  really  won’t 
change  that  much.  But  she’s 
only  in  town  a  few  days, 
which  is  why  I  need  to  be 
going  right  now.”  I  stood  up. 

“Where  are  you  going?” 
Casey  asked. 

“I  told  Mom  we’d  see  a 
movie  together  this 
afternoon.”  I  grabbed  my 
backpack  and  glanced  at  my 


reflection  in  the  mirror. 
“Sorry.  I  know  you  guys  want 
to  talk  about  it  or  whatever, 
but  Mom’s  leaving  at  the  end 
of  the  week,  so...” 

“You  sure  you’re  okay?” 
Casey  asked  skeptically. 

I  hesitated,  my  hand  raised 
to  brush  some  auburn  waves 
from  my  face.  I  could  have 
told  them  then.  I  could  have 
told  them  about  Dad  and  the 
beer  bottles  and  how 


confused  I  was.  They  were 
my  best  friends,  after  all. 

They  cared  about  me. 

But  if  I  ratted  Dad  out, 
what  would  happen?  What  if 
word  spread?  What  would 
people  think  of  him  then?  I 
couldn’t  handle  that.  Even  the 
thought  of  my  best  friends 
judging  him  made  me 
uncomfortable.  He  was  my 
dad,  after  all.  And  this  was  a 
small  thing.  He  was  just 


going  through  a  rough  patch. 
Nothing  to  worry  about. 

“Positive,”  I  said,  turning 
away  from  the  mirror  with  a 
forced  smile.  “But  I  should 
get  going.  I  don’t  want  Mom 
to  wait.” 

“Have  fun,”  Jessica 
murmured,  her  eyes  still  wide 
with  innocent  shock.  Maybe  I 
should  have  given  her  the 
news  a  little  more  gently. 

I  was  almost  out  the 


bathroom  door  when  Casey 
called  after  me.  “Hey,  B,  wait 
a  sec.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Let’s  go  out  this 
weekend,”  she  said.  “To 
make  up  for  not  hanging  out 
on  Valentine’s  Day.  We 
could  all  go  to  the  Nest.  A 
Girls’  Night  Out.  It’ll  be  fun. 
We’ll  even  buy  you  ice 
cream.” 

“Sure.  I’ll  call  you  later, 


but  I  really  have  to  go.” 

With  a  wave,  I  ran  out  of 
the  bathroom.  Yeah,  I  did 
want  to  see  a  movie  with 
Mom,  but  that  wasn’t  the 
reason  for  my  hurry.  There 
was  something  else  I  had  to 
do  first. 

Once  I  made  it  to  my  car, 
I  wasted  no  time  in  pulling 
out  my  cell  phone.  I  dialed 
the  familiar  number  and 
waited  for  the  professional 


male  voice  to  answer. 

“You’ve  reached  Tech 
Plus.  This  is  Ricky.  How  may 
I  assist  you?” 

I  wanted  to  talk  to  Dad. 

To  make  sure  he  was  okay 
and  let  him  know  we’d  get 
through  this.  Just,  you  know, 
be  supportive.  I  knew  he 
needed  it.  After  the  night  he’d 
had,  I  knew  he  must  be 
having  a  horrible  day  at  work. 
Besides,  if  I  was  dealing  with 


the  news  so  well,  I  could  at 
least  help  pull  him  through  it. 
“Good  afternoon,  Ricky,”  I 
said.  “Is  Mike  Piper 
available?” 

“I’m  afraid  not.  Mr.  Piper 
didn’t  come  in  today.” 

I  sat  there,  stunned  for  a 
minute,  knowing  what  that 
meant.  But  I  shook  off  the 
worries  creeping  into  my 
stomach.  He  was  just  having 
a  bad  hangover  after  a  rough 


night.  Probably  more  than 
enough  to  remind  him  why 
he’d  quit  drinking  in  the  first 
place.  He’d  be  fine  tomorrow. 

I  hoped. 

“Thank  you,  anyway,”  I 
said.  “Have  a  nice  day.” 

I  hung  up  the  phone  and 
started  to  dial  another 
number.  This  time  a  woman 
with  a  clear,  chirpy  voice 
answered. 

“Hello?” 


“Hey,  Mom.”  I  forced 
myself  to  sound  at  least  semi- 
upbeat.  If  I  was  too  happy, 
she’d  know  something  was 
up.  After  all,  I  just  wasn’t  the 
peppy  type.  “Still  want  to  go 
see  a  movie  tonight?” 

“Oh,  hi,  Bianca!”  Mom 
exclaimed.  “Yeah,  that 
sounds  great.  Listen,  honey, 
have  you  talked  to  your  dad 
today?  Is  he  okay?  He  just 
got  so  upset  last  night,  and  he 


was  crying  when  I  left.”  By 
the  way  she  spoke,  I  could 
tell  she  had  no  idea  he’d 
relapsed,  that  he’d  touched  a 
bottle.  If  she  did,  her  voice 
would  have  been  much  more 
strained,  full  of  concern. 
Maybe  even  on  the  verge  of 
panic.  But  she  sounded  calm. 
Only  slightly  worried.  The 
fact  that  she  was  so  blind 
really  bothered  me.  I  mean, 
he’d  quit  drinking  almost 


eighteen  years  ago,  but  still. 
The  thought  should  have 
crossed  her  mind. 

But  I  didn’t  want  to  be  the 
one  to  break  the  news  to  her. 

“He’s  fine.  I  just  got  off 
the  phone  with  him  a  second 
ago.  He’s  going  to  be  at  work 
late  tonight,  so  a  movie  works 
great  for  me.” 

“Oh,  okay.  I’m  glad  to 
hear  that,”  Mom  said.  “What 
do  you  want  to  see?  I  don’t 


even  know  what’s  in  theaters 
right  now.” 

“Me  neither,  but  I  was 
thinking  a  comedy  would  be 
good.” 


16 


Dad  wasn’t  better  the  next 
day. 

Or  the  day  after  that. 

He  went  back  to  work  at 
the  end  of  the  week,  but  I  was 
sure  I  wasn’t  the  only  one 
who  noticed  the  hangovers  he 
took  with  him.  It  seemed  like 


there  was  always  beer  or 
whiskey  lying  around  the 
house  now.  He  was  always 
passed  out  on  the  couch  or 
locked  in  his  room.  And  he 
never  mentioned  it  to  me.  As 
if  I  didn’t  notice.  Was  I 
supposed  to  ignore  it? 

Pretend  this  wasn’t  a 
problem? 

I  wanted  to  say  something. 
I  wanted  to  tell  him  to  stop. 

To  tell  him  he  was  making  a 


huge  mistake.  But  how?  How 
does  a  seventeen-year-old 
convince  her  father  that  she 
knows  what’s  best?  If  I  tried 
to  stop  him,  he  might  get 
defensive.  He  might  think  I’d 
abandoned  him,  too.  He 
might  get  angry  with  me. 

Since  Dad  had  stopped 
drinking  before  I  was  born,  I 
didn’t  really  know  much 
about  the  whole  sobriety 
process.  I  knew  that  he’d  had 


a  sponsor  once.  Some  tall, 
balding  man  from  Oak  Hill 
that  Mom  had  always  sent 
Christmas  cards  to  when  I 
was  a  kid.  Dad  didn’t  talk 
about  him  anymore,  and  I 
was  sure  that,  even  if  I  tried,  I 
wouldn’t  have  been  able  to 
locate  his  number.  If  I  had, 
what  would  I  say?  How  did 
that  whole  sponsor  thing  even 
work? 

I  felt  powerless  and 


useless  and,  more  than 
anything,  ashamed.  I  knew 
that,  with  Mom  gone,  it  was 
my  job  to  do  something.  I  just 
didn’t  have  a  clue  what  that 
something  was. 

So  in  the  weeks  after 
Mom  left  for  Tennessee,  I 
spent  most  of  my  time  at 
home  avoiding  Dad.  I’d  never 
really  seen  him  drunk  in  my 
life,  so  I  didn’t  know  what  to 
expect.  All  I  had  to  go  on 


were  the  little  bits  of 
conversations  I’d  overheard 
as  a  kid.  He’d  been  an  angry 
person  once.  He  had  a 
temper.  I  couldn’t  imagine 
this  coming  from  my  father, 
but  I  didn’t  want  to  start 
anytime  soon.  So  I  stayed  in 
my  bedroom,  and  he  stayed  in 
his. 

I  just  kept  telling  myself  it 
would  pass.  In  the  meantime, 
I’d  keep  his  little  secret  to 


myself.  Lucky  for  me,  Mom 
was  gullible  enough  to 
believe  me  whenever  I  told 
her  everything  was  fine  over 
the  phone,  despite  my  less 
than  awesome  acting  abilities. 

Honestly,  I  thought  hiding 
my  secrets  from  Casey  would 
be  the  hardest.  She  could 
always  see  right  through  me, 
after  all.  I  tried  avoiding  her 
at  first,  ignoring  her  phone 
calls  and  making  up  excuses 


when  she  asked  me  to  hang 
out.  I  never  called  her  about 
that  Girls’  Night  Out  she’d 
suggested  in  the  bathroom.  I 
was  sure  she’d  bombard  me 
with  questions  the  second  she 
got  me  alone,  so  I  always 
tried  to  use  poor  clueless 
Jessica  as  a  buffer.  But  within 
a  week,  I  got  this  strange 
feeling  that  Casey  was 
steering  clear  of  me. 

She  called  less  and  less. 


She  stopped  asking  if  I 
wanted  to  go  to  the  Nest  on 
weekends. 

She  even  switched  seats 
with  Jeanine  at  lunch,  putting 
herself  all  the  way  across  the 
table — as  far  away  from  me 
as  possible.  Once  or  twice,  I 
even  caught  her  giving  me 
dirty  looks. 

I  wanted  to  know  what  the 
hell  her  problem  was,  but  I 
was  scared  to  confront  her.  I 


knew  that  if  we  actually 
talked  about  it,  I  wouldn’t  be 
able  to  keep  lying  about  Dad. 
Not  to  her.  But  it  was  his 
secret,  his  shame,  not  mine  to 
tell.  I  wouldn’t  let  anyone, 
not  even  Casey,  find  out. 

So  I  had  to  let  her 
supreme  weirdness  slide  for 
the  time. 

Wesley  was  really  the 
only  thing  getting  me  through 
those  weeks.  Some  part  of  me 


was  appalled  at  myself,  but 
what  could  I  say?  I  needed 
that  escape — that  high — more 
than  ever,  and  he  was  always 
just  a  short  drive  away.  A  fix 
three  or  four  times  a  week 
was  all  it  took  to  keep  me 
sane. 

God,  I  was  like  a  fucking 
druggie.  Maybe  my  sanity 
was  long  gone  already. 

“What  would  you  do 
without  me?”  he  asked  one 


night.  We  were  tangled  in  the 
silky  sheets  of  his  gigantic 
bed.  My  heart  was  still 
pounding  as  I  came  down 
from  the  high  of  what  we’d 
just  done,  and  he  wasn’t 
helping  matters  by  putting  his 
lips  so  close  to  my  ear. 

“Live  a  happy. . .  happy 
life,”  I  murmured.  “I  might 
even. . .  be  an  optimist. . .  if 
you  weren’t  around.” 

“Liar.”  He  bit  my  earlobe 


playfully.  “You’d  be 
absolutely  miserable.  Admit 
it,  Duffy.  I’m  the  wind 
beneath  your  wings.” 

I  bit  my  lip,  but  I  still 
couldn’t  hold  back  the 
laughter — and  just  as  I  was 
finally  catching  my  breath, 
too.  “You  just  referenced 
Bette  Midler. . .  in  bed.  I’m 
starting  to  question  your 
sexuality,  Wesley.” 

Wesley  looked  at  me  with 


a  defiant  glint  in  his  eye.  “Oh, 
really?”  He  grinned  before 
moving  his  mouth  back  to  my 
ear  and  whispering,  “We  both 
know  that  my  manhood  has 
never  been  in  question. ...  I 
think  you’re  just  changing  the 
subject  because  you  know  it’s 
true.  I’m  the  light  of  your 
life.” 

“You. . .”  I  struggled  for 
words  as  Wesley  pressed  his 
mouth  into  the  crook  of  my 


neck.  The  tip  of  his  tongue 
moved  down  to  my  shoulder 
and  made  my  brain  get  all 
fuzzy.  How  was  I  supposed  to 
argue  under  these  conditions? 
“You  wish.  I’m  just  using 
you,  remember?” 

His  laughter  was  muffled 
against  my  skin.  “That’s 
amusing,”  he  said,  his  lips 
still  grazing  my  collarbone. 
“Because  I’m  pretty  sure  your 
ex  is  out  of  town  by  now.” 


One  of  his  hands  slid  between 
my  knees.  “Yet  you’re  still 
here,  aren’t  you?”  His  fingers 
began  gliding  up  and  down 
my  inner  thigh,  making  it 
difficult  for  me  to  think  of  a 
retort.  He  seemed  to  like  this, 
because  he  laughed  again.  “I 
don’t  think  you  hate  me, 
Duffy.  I  think  you  like  me  a 
lot.” 

I  squirmed  uncontrollably 
as  Wesley’s  fingertips  danced 


along  the  inside  of  my  leg.  I 
wanted  so  badly  to  argue,  but 
he  was  sending  electric 
currents  up  my  spine. 

Finally,  when  I  thought  I 
might  explode,  his  hand 
moved  to  my  hip  and  he 
pulled  his  mouth  away  from 
my  shoulder.  “Oh,  thank 
God,”  I  whispered  as  he 
reached  for  a  condom  in  the 
nightstand  drawer,  knowing 
what  came  next. 


“I  suppose  it’s  a  good 
thing  I  don’t  mind  having  you 
around,”  he  said  with  that 
cocky  grin.  “Now,  let  me 
answer  all  of  those  questions 
you  claim  to  have  about  my 
sexuality.” 

And  my  head  filled  with 
clouds  again. 

But  I  couldn’t  deny  things 
were  getting  way  out  of  hand. 
It  became  painfully  clear  to 
me  one  Friday  afternoon  in 


English  that  something 
wasn’t  right. 

Mrs.  Perkins  was  passing 
out  old  papers  she’d  graded 
and  chattering  away  about 
some  Nora  Roberts  book 
she’d  just  finished — totally 
unaware  that  no  one  was 
listening  to  her — when  she 
stopped  at  my  desk.  She  gave 
me  this  big,  goofy  smile,  like 
the  smile  of  a  proud 
grandmother.  “Your  essay 


was  wonderful,”  she 
whispered  to  me.  “Such  an 
interesting  take  on  Hester. 
You  and  Mr.  Rush  are  an 
excellent  team.”  Then  she 
handed  me  a  tan  folder  and 
patted  my  shoulder. 

I  opened  the  folder  as  she 
walked  away,  a  little 
confused  about  what  she’d 
said.  Inside  was  a  paper  that  I 
instantly  recognized.  Hester ’s 
Escape:  An  Analysis  by 


Bianca  Piper  and  Wesley 
Rush.  In  the  top-left  comer, 
Mrs.  Perkins  had  scribbled 
our  grade  in  bright  red  ink.  A 
ninety-eight.  An  A. 

I  couldn’t  help  but  beam 
at  the  paper.  Had  it  really 
been  only  a  month  and  a  half 
since  we’d  written  this  in 
Wesley’s  bedroom?  Since  the 
first  time  we’d  slept  together? 
It  felt  like  decades  had 
passed.  Millennia  even.  I 


looked  across  the  room  at 
him,  and  my  smile  vanished. 

He  was  talking  to  Louisa 
Farr.  No,  not  just  talking. 
Talking  just  involves  the 
vibration  of  vocal  cords,  and 
there  was  way  more  than  that 
going  on.  His  hand  was  on 
her  knee.  Her  cheeks  were 
getting  red.  He  was  giving 
her  his  cute,  cocky  grin. 

No!  Repulsive  grin.  Since 
when  did  I  think  that  display 


of  arrogance  was  cute?  And 
what  was  this  weird  twinge  I 
felt  in  my  stomach? 

I  looked  away  as  Louisa 
started  to  play  with  her 
necklace,  a  definite  sign  of 
flirting. 

Whore. 

I  shook  myself,  surprised 
and  a  little  worried.  What  was 
wrong  with  me?  Louisa  Farr 
wasn’t  a  whore.  Sure,  she  was 
a  preppy  cheerleader — 


cocaptain  of  the  Skinny 
Squad — but  Casey  had  never 
had  bad  things  to  say  about 
her.  The  girl  was  just  talking 
with  a  cute  guy.  We’d  all 
done  the  same.  And  it  wasn’t 
as  if  Wesley  was  taken  or 
anything.  It  wasn’t  like  he 
was  committed  to  anyone. 

Like  me... 

Oh  God 7  I  thought, 
realizing  what  that  twinge  in 
my  gut  must  mean.  Oh  God, 


I’m  jealous.  I’m  seriously 
fucking  jealous !  Oh,  shit ! 

I  decided  I  was  sick.  I  had 
a  fever  or  PMS  or  something 
was  severely  impairing  my 
mental  stability,  because 
there  was  no  way  in  hell  I’d 
be  jealous  that  a  man- whore 
like  Wesley  was  hitting  on 
someone  else.  I  mean,  that 
was  his  nature.  The  world 
might  have  actually  stopped 
spinning  if  Wesley  didn’t  flirt 


with  poor,  naive  girls.  Why 
should  I  be  jealous?  That  was 
ridiculous.  So  I  must  be  sick. 
I  had  to  be. 

“Are  you  okay,  Bianca?” 
Jessica  asked.  She  swiveled 
around  in  her  desk  to  look  at 
me.  “You  lookp.o.’ed.  Are 
you  mad  or  something?” 

“I’m  fine.”  But  my  words 
came  out  through  gritted 
teeth. 

“Okay,”  Jessica  said.  She 


was  just  as  gullible  as  my 
mom.  “Listen,  Bianca,  I 
really  think  you  should  talk  to 
Casey.  She’s  kind  of  upset, 
and  I  think  you  two  really 
need  to  have  a  heart-to-heart. 
Maybe  today?  After  class?” 

“Yeah. . .  whatever.”  But  I 
wasn’t  listening.  I  was  too 
busy  coming  up  with  ways  to 
mutilate  Louisa’s  perfect  little 
face. 

PMS.  This  was  definitely 


just  a  bad  case  of  PMS. 

I  got  my  ass  out  of  that 
classroom  the  second  the  bell 
rang.  My  head  would  explode 
if  I  had  to  hear  Louisa’s  girly, 
oh-I  ’  m-  so-happy-y  ou  ’  re- 
flirting- with-me- Wesley 
giggle  one  more  fucking  time. 
So  what  if  she  was  as  thin  as 
my  pinkie  and  had  boobs  the 
size  of  basketballs!  I  bet  she 
had  an  IQ  of  twenty-seven. 

Stop  it,  I  told  myself. 


Louisa  has  never  done 
anything  to  me.  I  have  no 
right  to  think  those  things 
about  her...  even  if  she  might 
be  a  moron. 

I  threw  my  stuff  into  my 
locker  and  ran  toward  the 
cafeteria,  eager  to  escape  the 
school  building.  I  was  so 
focused  on  not  thinking  about 
my  PMS-induced  jealousy 
that  I  didn’t  even  see  Toby 
until  I  skidded  to  a  stop  about 


six  inches  from  him. 

“In  a  hurry?”  he  asked  me. 

“Sort  of,”  I  sighed.  “Sorry 
for  almost  running  into  you.” 

“It’s  not  a  problem.”  He 
nervously  played  with  his 
glasses.  “But  do  you  think 
you’d  mind  slowing  down  the 
pace?  I’d  like  to  talk  to  you.” 

I  wasn’t  all  that  surprised. 
Toby  and  I  had  kind  of  gotten 
to  be  friends  over  the  past 
couple  weeks.  We  mostly 


talked  in  AP  government,  but 
you  know,  that  was  a  definite 
improvement.  Actually,  I’d 
even  become  somewhat 
comfortable  around  him. 
While  my  heart  still  fluttered 
a  little  when  he  walked  into 
the  room,  I  no  longer  worried 
about  losing  my  voice. 

“Sure.”  I  said.  At  least  it 
would  give  me  something 
else  to  think  about  for  a  few 
minutes. 


He  smiled  and  fell  into 
step  with  me.  “Can  you  keep 
a  secret?”  he  asked  as  we 
reached  the  cafeteria,  where 
the  student  body  congregated, 
waiting  for  the  final  bell  that 
would  dismiss  them  for  the 
afternoon. 

“Most  of  the  time.  Why?” 

“Do  you  remember  when  I 
missed  school  a  few  weeks 
ago?  The  day  after 
Valentine’s  Day?” 


“Uh-huh.  I  believe  that 
was  the  worst  day  of  Mr. 
Chaucer’s  life,”  I  said.  “I 
thought  the  guy  was  going  to 
cry  when  he  realized  no  one 
was  there  to  do  most  of  his 
job  for  him.” 

Toby  laughed — but  only  a 
small  laugh — and  said,  “I  was 
skipping  school...  well,  for 
an  interview.”  He  pulled  a 
large  envelope  from  the 
inside  of  his  blazer  and 


whispered,  “I  applied  to 
Harvard.  I  just  got  my  letter 
in  the  mail  this  morning.” 

“Why  is  that  a  secret?” 

His  cheeks  went  pink  in 
the  cutest  possible  way.  “I 
don’t  want  to  be  humiliated  if 
I  don’t  get  in,”  he  said. 

“You’ll  get  in.” 

“I  don’t  know  that.” 

“I  do.” 

“I  wish  I  had  as  much 
confidence  in  me  as  you  do.” 


“Oh,  come  on,  Toby,”  I 
said  seriously.  “All  great 
politicians — like  senators  and 
presidents — go  to  awesome 
colleges.  You’re  going  to  be  a 
great  politician,  so  they  have 
to  let  you  in.  Besides,  you’re 
one  of  the  smartest  kids  in  the 
senior  class.  You’re 
valedictorian,  aren’t  you?” 

“I  am,”  Toby  agreed, 
frowning  at  his  envelope. 
“But. . .  but  it’s  Harvard .” 


“And  you’re  Toby .”  I 
shrugged.  “Even  if  you  didn’t 
get  in,  there  are  a  million 
other  schools  that  would  kill 
to  have  you.  That  doesn’t 
matter,  though,  because  I 
know  you  got  in.  Do  yourself 
a  favor  and  open  the  letter.” 

Toby  stopped  in  the 
middle  of  the  cafeteria  and 
smiled  at  me.  “See,”  he  said, 
“this  is  why  I  wanted  you  to 
be  the  one  with  me  when  I

open  it.  I  knew  you’d  be — 

I  cut  him  off.  “While  I’m 
sure  the  next  few  words  out 
of  your  mouth  are  going  to  be 
incredibly  sweet,  I’m  one 
hundred  percent  aware  that 
you’re  stalling.  Open  the 
letter,  Toby.  Even  a  rejection 
is  better  than  putting  yourself 
through  this  hell.  You’ll  feel 
better  if  you  just  read  it.” 

“I  know.  I—” 

“Now.” 


He  ripped  open  the 
envelope,  and  I  realized  just 
how  odd  this  was.  He  was 
coming  to  me  with  this  very 
personal  thing.  For  support. 
For  encouragement.  Back  in 
January,  I  never  would  have 
imagined  commanding  Toby 
Tucker  to  open  his 
acceptance  letter.  I  never 
would  have  imagined 
speaking  to  him,  period. 

My,  oh  my,  how  things 


can  change. 

In  the  best  ways  possible, 
of  course. 

He  slid  the  paper  from  the 
torn  envelope  with  shaking 
fingers  and  began  to  read.  I 
watched  his  eyes  scan  the 
page  and  widen.  Was  that  joy 
or  heartbreak?  Shock, 
maybe?  Surprise  that  he  got 
in  or  surprise  that  he  hadn’t? 

“Well?” 


“I...  I  was  accepted.” 


Toby  dropped  the  paper  and 
let  it  float  gracefully  to  the 
floor.  “Bianca,  I  got  in!”  He 
grabbed  me  by  the  shoulders 
and  pulled  me  into  him, 
wrapping  his  arms  around 
me. 

That  was  something  else  I 
never  would  have  expected  to 
happen  back  in  January. 

“I  told  you  that  you 
would,”  I  said,  returning  the 
hug. 


Over  his  shoulder,  I 
spotted  Casey  and  Jessica 
walking  across  the  cafeteria. 
They  were  looking  at  me  as 
they  moved  through  the 
crowd  of  students;  they  saw 
me  wrapped  in  Toby’s  arms. 
But  for  some  reason  the 
expressions  on  their  faces 
didn’t  mirror  the  happiness  I 
felt.  Jessica  looked  kind  of 
sad,  but  Casey. . .  well,  she 
looked  downright  furious. 


Why?  What  was  going  on 
with  her?  With  both  of  them. 

Toby  squeezed  me  before 
letting  go  and  kneeling  down 
to  scoop  up  his  fallen  letter. 

“I  can’t  believe  it.  My  parents 
will  never  believe  it.” 

I  pulled  my  eyes  away 
from  my  friends  as  they 
vanished  behind  a  group  of 
freshmen  and  turned  my 
attention  back  to  the  beaming 
boy  in  front  of  me.  “If  they 


know  you  at  all,  Toby,  they’ll 
totally  believe  it,”  I  said. 
“We’ve  all  known  that  you’re 
destined  for  great  things  for  a 
long  time.  I  mean,  I’ve 
known  for  years.” 

Toby  looked  surprised. 
“Years?  But  we  really  didn’t 
start  talking  until  just  a  few 
weeks  ago.” 

“But  we’ve  had  classes 
together  since  we  were 
freshmen,”  I  reminded  him. 


“We  didn’t  have  to  talk  for 
me  to  know  you  were 
awesome.”  I  grinned  and 
clapped  him  on  the  back. 
“And  you  just  proved  me 
right.”  The  bell  rang,  and  I 
turned  toward  the  doors  that 
led  to  the  student  parking  lot. 
“See  you  later,  Toby. 
Congratulations !  ” 

“Yeah.  Thanks,  Bianca.” 

As  I  walked  to  the  double 
doors,  I  wondered  if  I’d  said 


too  much.  Did  I  give  myself 
away  as  a  semi-stalker?  God, 
I  hoped  not.  The  last  thing  I 
wanted  was  to  scare  the  poor 
guy  away  after  less  than  a 
month  of  actual  human 
contact.  That  would  really 
make  me  a  loser. 

I  was  about  to  push  open 
the  door  that  led  to  the 
student  parking  lot  when  a 
loud  “Ahem”  caught  my 
attention.  I  turned  around  and 


saw  Casey  leaning  against  the 
school’s  nearly  empty  trophy 
case,  her  arms  crossed  over 
her  chest.  The  way  her  eyes 
were  narrowed  annoyed  me 
right  away. 

“What?”  I  asked. 

She  scowled  and  let  her 
arms  fall  heavily  to  her  sides. 
“Nothing,”  she  grumbled. 
“Forget  it!” 

“Casey,  what  are  you — ?” 

“Not  now,  B.”  She  turned 


around  and  started  stomping 
away  from  me.  “I  have  cheer 
practice.” 

My  hands  flew 
automatically  to  my  hips. 
“What  the  fuck  is  wrong  with 
you?”  I  demanded.  “You 
sound  like  a  total  bitch.” 

She  stopped  and  looked 
over  her  shoulder  at  me.  “I’m 
the  bitch?  You  ignore  me,  and 
I’m  the  bitch?  WTF,  Bianca!” 
She  shook  her  head. 


“Whatever.  I’m  not  having 
this  conversation  right  now. 
Not  when  we  were  supposed 
to  have  it  ten  minutes  ago, 
like  you  told  Jess  we  would.  I 
guess  you  were  too  busy 
hanging  all  over  that  geek  to 

“Criticizing  Toby  sounds 
pretty  damn  bitchy  to  me, 
Casey,”  I  snapped.  How  dare 
she!  She  knew  I  liked  him. 
She  knew  that  having  him 


pay  any  attention  to  me  was  a 
big  deal!  She  knew,  and  yet 
she  was  bitching  at  me  for  it? 
“You’re  acting  like  a  preppy 
cheerleader  snob.” 

Her  eyes  flashed,  and  for  a 
second  it  looked  like  she 
might  pounce  on  me.  I 
seriously  thought  I  was  going 
to  get  into  an  all-out,  hair¬ 
pulling,  reality-show  girl 
fight  with  my  best  friend  right 
in  front  of  the  parking  lot 


doors. 

But  she  walked  away.  Not 
a  word.  Not  even  a  sound. 

She  just  drifted  toward  the 
gymnasium,  leaving  me 
pissed  and  totally  confused. 

I’d  fought  with  Casey 
before;  it’s  bound  to  happen 
when  you’ve  been  friends  as 
long  as  we  had.  But  this 
argument  really  unnerved  me, 
mostly  because  I  didn’t  know 
what  her  deal  was.  I  stormed 


across  the  parking  lot,  trying 
to  figure  out  what  I  could 
have  done  to  deserve  that 
drama.  Clearly  I’d  set  her  off 
somehow. 

And  of  course  things  just 
had  to  get  better  and  better. 

My  car  wouldn’t  start.  I 
tried  and  tried  again,  but  still 
got  nothing.  The  battery  was 
completely  dead. 

“Fuck!”  I  yelled, 
slamming  my  fist  into  the 


steering  wheel.  This  was  not 
what  I  needed.  Hadn’t  my 
day  been  bad  enough?  Hadn’t 
my  life  been  bad  enough?  It 
was  like  nothing  ever  went 
right.  “Shit!  Damn!  Hell! 
Start,  you  piece  of — ” 

“Having  car  problems, 
Duffy?” 

I  paused  mid-rant  to  glare 
at  the  offending  shadow.  I 
opened  the  door  and  told 
Wesley,  “My  fucking  car 


won’t  turn  on.”  Then  I  saw 
the  girl  standing  next  to  him. 

Skinny.  Big  boobs.  It 
wasn’t  Louisa  Farr.  This  girl 
was  cuter.  She  had  a  round, 
sweet  face  with  curly  brown 
hair  that  bounced  around  her 
shoulders  and  large  gray  eyes. 
Way  prettier  than  me,  of 
course.  Probably  some 
freshman  who  only  had  to 
take  one  look  at  Wesley’s 
sexy  smile  and  pretty,  shiny 


car  before  she  put  out.  Again, 
that  twinge  of  jealousy 
overpowered  me.  Just  PMS. 

“Would  you  like  me  to 
give  you  a  ride?”  he  asked. 

“No,”  I  said  quickly.  “I’ll 
just  call. . .”  But  who  would  I 
call?  Mom  was  in  Tennessee. 
Dad  was  at  work.  Casey  had 
cheer  practice.  Not  that  it 
mattered.  She  was  pissed  at 
me  anyway,  and  she  and  Jess 
both  relied  on  their  parents — 


or  me — to  drive  them  around. 
Who  would  come  get  me? 

“Come  on,  Duffy,” 
Wesley  said,  grinning  at  me. 
“You  know  you  want  to  ride 
with  me.”  He  bent  down  to 
look  me  in  the  eyes.  “What’s 
the  worst  that  could  happen?” 

“That’s  okay.”  There  was 
no  way  I  was  riding  in  the 
same  car  as  Wesley  and  his 
latest  conquest.  Nope.  Not  a 
chance. 


“Don’t  be  ridiculous.  You 
can  call  someone  later. 
There’s  no  point  staying  in 
the  parking  lot  until  dark.  I 
just  have  to  drop  Amy  off, 
and  then  I  can  take  you 
home.” 

Amy,  I  thought.  So  that ’s 
the  bimbo ’s  name. 

Then  something  in  the 
back  of  my  mind  clicked. 

Oh  my  God!  Amy!  Amy 
was  his  sister!  I  looked  at  the 


girl  again,  wondering  how  I’d 
missed  it.  Curly  brown  hair, 
dark  gray  eyes,  very 
attractive.  Duh.  The 
resemblance  was  obvious.  I 
was  an  unbelievable 
dumbass. 

Wesley  reached  past  me 
and  pulled  my  keys  out  of  the 
ignition. 

“Fine,”  I  said,  feeling 
significantly  better.  I 
snatched  back  my  keys  and 


dropped  them  into  my  purse. 
“Let  me  get  my  stuff.”  Once  I 
had  everything  I  needed,  I 
locked  the  doors  and 
followed  Wesley  to  his  car, 
which  was  easy  to  spot  since 
it  was  the  only  Porsche  in  the 
parking  lot. 

“Now,  Duffy,”  Wesley 
said  as  he  climbed  into  the 
driver’s  seat.  I  slid  into  the 
back  so  that  Amy,  who  was 
apparently  the  quiet  type, 


could  sit  with  her  brother. 
“This  means  you’ll  actually 
have  to  admit  that  I  do  nice 
things  for  people  on 
occasion.” 

“I  never  said  you  don’t  do 
nice  things,”  I  told  him  as  I 
attempted  to  situate  myself  in 
the  cramped  backseat.  God, 
for  being  such  fancy  cars, 
Porches  had  zero  legroom.  I 
had  to  sit  sideways  with  my 
knees  pulled  up  to  my  chest. 


So  not  comfortable.  “You  do. 
But  only  when  it  benefits  you 
in  some  way.” 

Wesley  scoffed.  “Did  you 
hear  that,  Amy?  Can  you 
believe  what  she  thinks  of 
me?” 

“I’m  sure  Amy  knows 
what  you’re  like.” 

Wesley  went  silent. 

Amy  laughed  but  she 
seemed  kind  of  nervous. 

She  didn’t  say  much 


during  the  ride,  though 
Wesley  made  several 
attempts  to  coax  her  into  our 
conversation.  At  first  I 
wondered  if  maybe  it  was 
because  of  me,  but  it  didn’t 
take  long  to  figure  out  that 
she  was  just  shy.  When  we 
pulled  into  the  driveway  of 
the  large,  old-fashioned 
house,  which  I  knew  must 
belong  to  Wesley’s 
grandmother,  Amy  looked 


into  the  backseat  and  said 
quietly,  “Bye.  It  was  nice  to 
meet  you,”  before  ducking 
out  of  the  car. 

“She’s  sweet,”  I  said. 

“She  needs  to  break  out  of 
her  shell.”  Wesley  sighed  as 
he  watched  her  hurry  up  to 
the  front  porch.  Once  she’d 
disappeared  into  the  big 
house  (it  was  no  almost- 
mansion,  but  clearly  his 
grandma  had  money,  too),  he 


looked  back  at  me.  “You  can 
take  the  front  seat  if  you 
want.” 

I  nodded  and  got  out  of 
the  car.  I  opened  the 
passenger’s  door  and  eased 
myself  into  the  seat  Amy  had 
just  abandoned.  Right  around 
the  time  I  got  my  seat  belt 
fastened,  I  heard  Wesley  let 
out  a  low  groan.  “What’s 
your  problem?”  I  asked, 
looking  up.  But  I  figured  out 


the  answer  before  he  said  a 
word. 

A  woman  in  her  sixties 
had  just  come  out  of  the 
house,  and  she  was  walking 
toward  the  car.  Wesley’s 
grandma,  no  doubt.  Wesley’s 
grandma  who  hated  him.  No 
wonder  he  looked  like  he 
wanted  to  hide.  I  felt  a  little 
anxious  as  I  watched  the 
woman,  who  was  very  well 
dressed  in  an  expensive- 


looking  salmon  sweater  and 
perfectly  creased  slacks, 
stride  toward  the  car. 

Wesley  rolled  down  his 
window  when  she  got  close 
enough  to  hear  him.  “Hi, 
Grandma  Rush.  How  are 
you?” 

“Don’t  play  with  me, 
Wesley  Benjamin.  I’m 
furious  with  you  at  the 
moment.”  But  she  didn’t 
sound  furious.  Her  voice  was 


high-pitched  and  soft.  Silky. 
She  sounded  like  the  sweetest 
old  woman  ever,  but  her 
words  didn’t  fit  the  part. 

“What  did  I  do  this  time?” 
Wesley  asked  with  a  sigh. 
“Wear  the  wrong  shoes?  Or  is 
it  that  the  car  isn’t  clean 
enough  today?  What  mild 
imperfection  are  you  going  to 
throw  at  me  this  afternoon?” 

“I  would  suggest  you 
refrain  from  using  that  tone 


with  me,”  she  said  in  the  least 
intimidating  voice 
imaginable.  This  would  have 
been  fimny  if  Wesley  didn’t 
look  so  unhappy.  “Live  your 
life  how  you  like,  but  leave 
little  Amy  out  of  it.” 

“Amy?  What  did  I  do  to 
Amy?” 

“Honestly,  Wesley,”  his 
grandma  said  with  a  dramatic 
sigh.  “Why  don’t  you  just  let 
Amy  take  the  bus?  I  don’t 


approve  of  you  driving  her 
around  with  your” — she 
paused — “friends  in  the 
backseat.”  She  looked  across 
Wesley,  her  eyes  locking  with 
mine  for  an  instant  before 
shifting  back  to  her  grandson. 
“I  wouldn’t  want  them  to  be  a 
negative  influence  on  your 
sister.” 

For  a  second  I  was 
confused.  I  was  a  straight-A 
student.  I’d  never  been  in  any 


trouble  in  my  life.  Yet  this 
woman  thought  I  would 
somehow  damage  her 
precious  granddaughter. 

And  then  it  hit  me. 

She  thought  I  was  one  of 
Wesley’s  tramps.  She  thought 
I  was  a  slutty  chick  he 
screwed  around  with.  Wesley 
had  told  me  that  his 
grandmother  disapproved  of 
his  “lifestyle.”  She  hated  the 
way  he  slept  around.  And 


seeing  me  in  the  backseat, 
she’d  just  assumed  I  was 
another  floozy  he’d  picked 
up. 

I  looked  away,  staring  out 
my  window  to  avoid  seeing 
the  expression  of  disgust  on 
the  old  woman’s  face.  I  felt 
hurt  and  angry. 

Mostly  because  I  knew  it 
was  true. 

“That  is  none  of  your 
business,”  Wesley  growled. 


I’d  never  heard  him  sound  so 
pissed  before.  “You  have  no 
right  to  disrespect  my  friend, 
and  it  certainly  isn’t  your 
place  to  decide  what  I  do  with 
my  own  sister.  You  should 
know  me  well  enough  to 
know  that  I  wouldn’t  do 
anything  to  harm  her,  despite 
what  you’ve  convinced  her 
of.  I’m  not  the  monster  you 
tell  her  I  am,  you  know.” 

“I  think  I  should  drive 


Amy  home  from  school  after 
today.” 

“Go  ahead,”  he  said.  “But 
you  won’t  keep  me  away 
from  her.  She’s  my  sister,  and 
Mom  and  Dad  will  have  a  fit 
if  I  tell  them  that  you’re 
trying  to  break  apart  our 
family,  Grandmother.” 

“I’m  afraid  your  family  is 
already  broken,  my  dear.” 

There  was  a  buzz, 
indicating  that  Wesley  had 


rolled  his  window  back  up, 
and  the  engine  revved.  I 
watched  as  the  old  woman 
walked  back  toward  her 
house.  Then,  with  squealing 
tires,  Wesley  backed  out  of 
the  driveway  and  sped  down 
the  street.  I  glanced  over  at 
him,  worried  and  unsure  of 
what  to  say.  Luckily,  he 
spoke  first. 

“I’m  sorry.  I  didn’t  know 
she  was  coming  outside.  She 


shouldn’t  have  treated  you 
that  way.” 

“It’s  okay,”  I  said. 

“No,  it’s  not.  She’s  a 
shrew.” 

“I  gathered  that  much.” 

“And  the  worst  part  is  that 
she’s  right.” 

“About  what?”  I  asked. 

“About  our  family,”  he 
said.  “She’s  right.  It  is 
broken.  It  has  been  for  a  long 
time.  Mom  and  Dad  are 


always  gone,  and  Grandma’s 
managed  to  come  between 
Amy  and  me.” 

“Amy  still  loves  you.” 

“Maybe,”  he  murmured. 
“But  she  thinks  less  of  me. 
Grandma  has  her  convinced 
that  I’m  some  no-good  son  of 
a  bitch.  I’ve  seen  the  way 
Amy  looks  at  me  now.  She 
looks  at  me  like  she’s  sad. 
Like  she’s  disappointed  in 
me.  She  thinks  I’m  a  horrible 


person.” 

“I’m  sorry,”  I  said  quietly. 
“If  I’d  known,  I  wouldn’t 
have  made  the  joke  about  you 
only  doing  nice  things  for. . . 
for  benefits.” 

“It’s  fine.”  The  car  was 
slowing  down  a  little. 
“Honestly,  you’re  right.  And 
Grandma  is,  too.  I  just  never 
wanted  Amy  to  see  me  that 
way.” 

I  couldn’t  resist  the  urge 


to  reach  over  to  the  gearshift 
and  put  my  hand  over 
Wesley’s.  His  skin  was  warm 
and  soft,  and  I  could  feel  his 
pulse  throbbing  steadily 
beneath  my  palm.  I  forgot 
about  my  stupid  car  and  my 
fight  with  Casey.  I  just 
wanted  Wesley  to  smile 
again.  Even  that  cocky  grin 
would  have  worked.  I  hated 
that  he  was  so  hurt  by  the 
possibility  of  losing  his 


sister’s  respect.  I  wanted  to 
comfort  him.  I  cared  about 
him. 

Oh  my  God.  I  actually 

cared? 


17 


Ten  minutes  later,  the 
Porsche  pulled  into  my 
driveway.  I  grabbed  my  stuff 
and  reached  for  the  door 
handle.  “Thanks  for  the  ride.” 
A  glance  back  over  my 
shoulder  showed  me  that 
Wesley  was  still  sulky.  Well, 


hell!  Why  not?  “You  can 
come  inside  if  you  want.  My 
dad  isn’t  home  yet.” 

Wesley  grinned  at  me  as 
he  cut  the  engine.  “You’re  a 
dirty-minded  little  girl,  Duffy. 
It  would  appear  that  you’re 
trying  to  corrupt  me.” 

“You’re  way  past 
corruption,”  I  assured  him. 

We  got  out  of  the  car  and 
walked  up  the  driveway 
together.  I  dug  the  keys  out  of 


my  purse  and  unlocked  the 
front  door,  allowing  Wesley 
to  walk  inside  ahead  of  me.  I 
watched  his  eyes  move 
around  the  living  room,  and  I 
couldn’t  help  feeling  a  little 
self-conscious.  He  must  have 
been  comparing  the  place  to 
his  almost-mansion. 
Obviously  there  was  no 
comparison.  I  didn’t  even  live 
in  a  coatrack  house  like 
Jessica. 


“I  like  it,”  Wesley  said. 

He  looked  back  at  me.  “It’s 
cozy.” 

“That’s  nice  for  small, 
isn’t  it?” 

“No.  I’m  serious.  It’s 
comfortable.  My  house  is  too 
big,  even  for  four  people,  and 
since  I’m  the  only  one  in  it 
most  of  the  time. . .  I  like 
yours  better.  Cozy,  like  I 
said.” 


“Thanks.”  I  was  flattered. 


Not  that  I  cared  what  he 
thought,  but. . . 

“Where’s  your  room?”  he 
asked,  winking  at  me. 

“I  knew  that  was  coming. 
Now  who’s  corrupting 
whom?”  I  took  him  by  the 
elbow  and  led  him  up  the 
stairs.  “Right  here.”  I 
gestured  to  the  first  door.  “I 
warn  you,  it’s  about  the  size 
of  a  Cracker  Jack  box.” 

He  opened  the  door  and 


peered  inside.  Then  he  looked 
back  at  me  with  that  familiar 
smirk.  “We’ll  have  enough 
room.” 

“Enough  room  for  what?” 

Before  I  knew  what  was 
happening,  Wesley  had 
grabbed  me  by  the  hips  and 
was  pushing  me  into  my 
bedroom.  He  kicked  the  door 
shut  behind  us,  spun  me 
around,  and  slammed  me 
against  the  wall,  where  he 


began  kissing  me  so  hard  that 
I  thought  my  head  might  pop 
off.  I  was  surprised,  but  once 
that  wore  off,  I  joined  in.  I 
wrapped  my  arms  around  his 
neck  and  kissed  him  back.  He 
tightened  his  grip  on  my 
waist  and  shoved  my  jeans 
down  as  low  as  they  would 
go  without  unbuttoning.  Then 
he  slid  his  hands  under  the 
elastic  band  of  my  underwear 
and  rubbed  his  fingers  along 


my  hot,  tingling  skin. 

After  a  few  minutes,  he 
pulled  his  mouth  away  from 
mine.  “Bianca,  can  I  ask  you 
something?” 

“No,”  I  said  quickly.  “I 
am  not  giving  you  a  blow  job. 
No  fucking  way.  Just  the 
thought  of  it  is  disgusting  and 
degrading  and. . .  No.  Never.” 

“While  that’s  a  little 
disappointing,”  Wesley  said, 
“it’s  not  what  I  was  planning 


to  ask  you.” 

“Oh.”  That  was  a  little 
embarrassing.  “Well,  then 
what?” 

He  took  his  hands  out  of 
my  pants  and  placed  them 
gently  on  my  shoulders. 
“What  are  you  escaping  from 
now?” 

“Excuse  me?” 

“I  know  your  ex-boyfriend 
left  town  weeks  ago,”  he  said. 
“But  I  can  tell  there  is  still 


something  bothering  you.  As 
much  as  I’d  like  to  believe 
it’s  just  me — you  can’t  get 
enough  of  me — I  know 
there’s  more  to  it.  What  are 
you  running  from,  Bianca?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Don’t  lie.” 

“It’s  none  of  your 
business,  okay?”  I  pushed 
him  away  from  me  and 
yanked  my  jeans  back  up 
where  they  belonged. 


Automatically,  I  knelt  down 
by  the  pile  of  clean  clothes  at 
the  foot  of  my  bed  and  started 
folding  them.  “Let’s  just  talk 
about  something  else.” 

Wesley  sat  down  on  the 
floor  beside  me.  “Fine,”  he 
said.  I  could  tell  he  was  using 
that  ITl-be-patient-until-you- 
decide-to-tell-me  voice.  The 
one  you  use  with  little  kids. 
Too  bad  for  him.  That  would 
never  happen.  He  was  just  my 


sex  toy,  after  all,  not  my 
psychiatrist. 

We  talked  about  school 
while  I  folded  my  clothes. 
When  they  were  all  in  neat 
stacks,  I  stood  up  and  moved 
to  sit  on  my  bed. 

“Aren’t  you  going  to  put 
them  away?”  Wesley  asked. 

“No,”  I  said. 

“Then  what  was  the  point 
in  folding  them?” 

I  sighed  and  stretched  out 


on  my  back,  kicking  off  my 
Converse.  “I  don’t  know,”  I 
admitted,  resting  my  head  on 
the  pillow  and  staring  at  the 
ceiling.  “I  guess  it’s  a  habit  or 
whatever.  I  fold  the  clothes 
every  night,  and  it  makes  me 
feel  better.  It’s  relaxing  and  it 
clears  my  head.  Then  the  next 
morning,  I  dig  through  the 
stacks  for  what  I’m  gonna 
wear,  and  they  all  get  messed 
up,  so  I  get  to  fold  them  again 


that  night.  Like  a  cycle.” 

My  bed  creaked  as 
Wesley  climbed  on  top  of  me, 
wedging  himself  between  my 
knees.  “You  know,”  he  said, 
looking  down  at  me.  “That’s 
pretty  strange.  Neurotic, 
really.” 

“Me?”  I  laughed.  “You’re 
the  one  who’s  trying  to  get  in 
my  pants  again,  like,  ten 
seconds  after  a  failed  attempt 
at  a  heart-to-heart.  I’d  say 


we’re  both  pretty  fucked  up.” 

“Very  true.” 

We  started  kissing  again. 
This  time  his  hands  moved  up 
my  shirt  and  unhooked  my 
bra.  There  wasn’t  much  room 
in  my  little  twin  bed,  but 
Wesley  still  managed  to  get 
my  top  off  and  my  jeans 
unzipped  in  record  time.  I 
started  to  undo  his  pants,  too, 
but  he  stopped  me. 

“No,”  he  said,  moving  my 


hand  away.  “You  might  not 
agree  with  blow  jobs,  but  I 
have  a  feeling  you’ll  enjoy 
this.” 

I  opened  my  mouth  to 
argue  but  shut  it  quickly  as  he 
started  kissing  down  my 
stomach.  His  hands  began 
moving  my  jeans  and 
underwear  down  toward  my 
knees,  one  of  them  pausing 
briefly  to  squeeze  the  ticklish 
place  above  my  hip,  causing 


me  to  jerk  once  with  a  giggle. 
His  lips  moved  lower  and 
lower,  and  I  was  surprised  by 
how  much  I  was  anticipating 
their  final  destination. 

I’d  heard  Vikki  and  even 
Casey  talk  about  their 
boyfriends  going  down  on 
them  and  how  good  it  felt.  I’d 
heard,  but  I  didn’t  entirely 
believe  it.  Jake  and  I  had 
never  done  that,  and  I’d 
always  just  assumed  it  was 


gross  and  weird. 

It  was  kind  of  weird  at 
first,  but  then  it  wasn’t 
anymore.  It  felt. . .  strange — 
but  in  a  good  way.  Dirty, 
wrong,  amazing.  My  fingers 
curled  in  the  sheets,  gripping 
the  cloth  tightly,  and  my 
knees  shook.  I  was  feeling 
things  I’d  never  felt  before. 
“Ah,. . .  oh,”  I  gasped  with 
pleasure  and  surprise  and — 

“Oh,  shit.” 


Wesley  jumped  away 
from  me.  He’d  heard  the  car 
door  slam,  too.  That  meant 
my  dad  was  home. 

I  pulled  up  my  underwear 
and  fastened  my  jeans 
quickly,  but  it  took  me  a 
minute  to  find  my  bra.  Once  I 
was  completely  dressed,  I 
flattened  my  hair  and  did  my 
best  not  to  look  like  a  kid 
with  her  hand  caught  in  the 
cookie  jar. 


“Should  I  leave?”  Wesley 
asked. 

“No,”  I  said  breathlessly.  I 
could  tell  he  didn’t  want  to  go 
back  to  the  empty  almost- 
mansion.  “Stay  a  little  while. 
It’s  fine.  Dad  won’t  care.  We 
just  can’t. . .  do  that .” 

“What  else  is  there  to  do?” 

So,  like  complete  losers, 
we  played  Scrabble  for  the 
next  four  and  a  half  hours. 
There  was  barely  enough 


space  in  the  floor  of  my  tiny 
room  for  someone  as  tall  as 
Wesley  to  stretch  out  on  his 
stomach,  but  he  managed, 
and  I  sat  across  from  him,  the 
board  between  us  as  we 
spelled  out  words  like 
quixotic  and  hegemony.  Not 
exactly  the  most  exciting 
Friday  night,  but  I  enjoyed  it 
way  more  than  I  would  have 
if  I’d  gone  to  the  Nest  or 
some  lame  party  in  Oak  Hill. 


Around  nine,  after  I’d 
kicked  his  ass  three  times — 
finally,  something  I  could 
beat  him  at! — Wesley  got  to 
his  feet.  “I  guess  I  should  go 
home,”  he  sighed. 

“Okay.”  I  stood  up.  “I’ll 
walk  you  downstairs.” 

I  was  in  such  a  good  mood 
that  I’d  managed  to  forget  all 
about  Dad. . .  until  we  ran  into 
him  in  the  living  room.  I 
smelled  the  whiskey  before  I 


saw  the  bottle  on  the  coffee 
table,  and  my  cheeks  burned 
with  embarrassment.  Please 
don ’t  notice ,  I  thought  to 
myself  as  I  walked  Wesley 
toward  the  front  door.  I  guess 
I  should’ve  started  worrying 
when  he  hadn’t  checked 
upstairs  to  see  whose  Porsche 
was  in  our  driveway.  I  mean, 
it  wasn’t  like  having  a  car 
that  shiny  in  front  of  our 
house  was  a  common 


occurrence.  Maybe  Wesley 
hadn’t  thought  about  that 
either.  It  was  a  Friday  night, 
after  all.  Dads  could  drink 
whiskey  on  weekends. . .  well, 
ones  that  weren’t  recovering 
alcoholics,  but  Wesley  didn’t 
know  that  side  of  the  story. 

As  long  as  my  father  acted 
normal,  this  might  slide  by  as 
nothing  out  of  the  ordinary. 

But,  of  course,  I  never  had 
that  kind  of  good  luck. 


“Bumblebee!”  Dad  said, 
and  I  could  tell  he  was 
already  smashed.  Great.  Just 
fucking  fantastic.  He 
stumbled  to  his  feet  and 
looked  over  at  the  front  door, 
where  Wesley  and  I  stood. 
“Hey,  Bumblebee.  I  didn’t 
even  know  you  were  home. 
Who’s  this?”  His  eyes 
narrowed  at  Wesley.  “A 
boy?” 

“Urn,  Dad,  this  is  Wesley 


Rush,”  I  said,  trying  to  stay 
calm.  “He’s  a  friend  of 
mine.” 

“A  ‘friend.’...  I  bet.”  He 
grabbed  the  whiskey  bottle 
before  taking  a  few  unsteady 
steps  toward  us,  his  eyes 
squinting  at  Wesley.  “Did 
you  have  fun  up  in  my  little 
girl’s  bedroom,  boy?” 

“I  sure  did,”  Wesley  said, 
clearly  trying  to  sound  like 
one  of  those  innocent  oh-gee- 


whiz!  boys  from  fifties  TV 
shows.  “We  played  three 
games  of  Scrabble.  Your 
daughter  is  really  good  with 
words,  sir.” 

“Scrabble?  I’m  not  an 
idiot.  That  must  be  some  new 
code  for. . .  for  oral  sex!”  Dad 
snarled. 

I  must  have  turned  scarlet. 
How  did  he  know?  Could  he 
see  right  into  my  mind?  No, 
of  course  he  couldn’t.  He  was 


just  drunk  and  making 
accusations,  and  looking 
guilty  would  only  make 
things  worse.  So  I  laughed  as 
if  it  were  ridiculous.  As  if  it 
were  a  joke.  Wesley, 
following  my  lead,  did  the 
same. 

“Sure,  Dad,”  I  said.  “And 
intercourse  is  Yahtzee, 
right?” 

“I’m  not  being  funny!” 
Dad  snapped,  swinging  his 


bottle  and  sloshing  whiskey 
onto  the  carpet.  Wonderful. 
I’d  be  the  one  cleaning  that 
up.  “I  know  what’s  up.  I’ve 
seen  the  way  your  slutty 
friends  dress,  Bianca.  They’re 
rubbing  off  on  you,  aren’t 
they?” 

I  couldn’t  force  the 
laughter  any  longer.  “My 
friends  aren’t  slutty,”  I 
whispered.  “You’re  drunk  off 
your  ass,  and  you  don’t  know 


what  you’re  saying.”  With  a 
surge  of  bravery,  I  reached 
forward  and  swiped  the  bottle 
from  his  hand.  “You 
shouldn’t  have  any  more, 
Dad.” 

For  a  second,  I  felt  good. 
That  was  what  I  should  have 
done  all  along.  Just  taken 
things  into  my  own  hands  and 
removed  the  bottle.  I  felt 
empowered.  Like  I  could  fix 
things. 


“I  should  go,”  Wesley  said 
behind  me. 

I  started  to  turn  around 
and  say  bye,  but  the  words 
never  left  my  mouth.  I  felt  the 
bottle  slip  from  my  hand  and 
heard  it  smash  on  the  floor 
beside  me.  I  was  knocked  to 
the  ground,  but  for  a  second  I 
didn’t  understand  what  had 
happened.  Then  the  delayed 
pain  in  my  temple  stunned 
me.  It  was  like  I’d  been  hit  by 


something.  Something  hard. 
Something  blunt.  Something 
like  the  palm  of  my  father’s 
hand.  I  reached  up  and 
rubbed  my  head  in  shock, 
barely  feeling  the  actual  pain. 

“See!”  Dad  yelled.  “Boys 
don’t  stay  with  whores, 
Bianca.  They  leave  them. 
And  I’m  not  going  to  let  you 
turn  into  a  whore.  Not  my 
daughter.  This  is  for  your 
own  good.” 


I  looked  up  as  he  reached 
a  hand  down  to  grab  my  arm. 
I  squeezed  my  eyes  shut, 
waiting  to  feel  his  fingers 
clamp  around  my  forearm. 

But  they  never  did. 

I  heard  a  loud  thud,  and 
Dad  grunted  in  pain.  My  eyes 
flew  open.  Wesley  moved 
away  from  Dad,  who  was 
massaging  his  jaw  with  a 
shocked  look  on  his  face. 
“Why  you  little  shithead!” 


“Are  you  all  right?” 
Wesley  asked,  kneeling  in 
front  of  me. 

“Did  you  just  punch  my 
dad?”  I  couldn’t  help  but 
wonder  if  I  was  delirious. 
Had  all  of  this  really  just 
happened?  Totally  bizarre. 

“Yes,”  Wesley  admitted. 

“How  dare  you  touch 
me!”  Dad  screamed,  but  he 
was  having  trouble  balancing 
enough  to  approach  us  again. 


“How  dare  you  fuck  my 
daughter,  then  hit  me,  you 
son  of  a  bitch!” 

I’d  never  heard  my  father 
swear  like  that  before. 

“Come  on,”  Wesley  said, 
helping  me  to  my  feet.  “Let’s 
get  out  of  here.  You’re 
coming  with  me.”  He 
wrapped  an  arm  around  me, 
pulling  me  close  against  his 
warm  body,  and  ushered  me 
out  the  open  door. 


“Bianca!”  Dad  yelled 
behind  us.  “You  better  not  get 
in  that  damn  car!  You  better 
not  leave  this  house!  You 
hear  me,  you  little  whore!” 

The  ride  to  Wesley’s  house 
passed  in  silence.  Several 
times  I  saw  him  open  his 
mouth  like  he  wanted  to 
speak,  but  he  always  shut  it 
again.  I  was  in  too  much 
shock  to  say  anything.  My 


head  didn’t  hurt  that  much.  I 
just  couldn’t  wrap  my  head 
around  what  Dad  had  done. 
But  worse  was  the 
embarrassment.  Why?  Why 
did  Wesley  have  to  see  that? 
What  did  he  think  of  me 
now?  What  did  he  think  of 
Dad? 

“That’s  never  happened 
before,”  I  said,  breaking  the 
silence  when  we  pulled  into 
the  driveway  of  the  almost- 


mansion.  Wesley  cut  the 
engine  and  looked  over  at  me. 
“Dad’s  never  hit  me. . .  or 
even  yelled  at  me  like  that 
before.” 

“All  right.” 

“I  just  want  you  to  know 
that  wasn’t  normal  for  us,”  I 
explained.  “I  don’t  live  in  an 
abusive  house  or  anything.  I 
don’t  want  you  to  think  my 
dad  is  some  kind  of 
psychopath.” 


“I  was  under  the 
impression  that  you  didn’t 
care  what  people  thought,”  he 
said. 

“About  me.  I  don’t  care 
what  they  think  about  me .”  I 
didn’t  know  that  was  a  lie 
until  the  words  had  left  my 
mouth.  “But  my  family  and 
friends  are  different. . . .  My 
dad  isn’t  a  psychopath.  He’s 
just  having  a  rough  time  right 
now.”  I  could  feel  the  lump 


rising  in  my  throat,  and  I  tried 
to  gulp  it  down.  I  needed  to 
explain.  He  needed  to  know. 
“My  mom  just  filed  for  a 
divorce,  and. . .  and  he  just 
can’t  handle  it.” 

The  lump  wasn’t  going 
away.  It  just  kept  growing. 

All  of  my  worries  and  fears 
had  been  leading  up  to  this 
moment,  and  I  couldn’t  fight 
them  back  anymore.  I 
couldn’t  keep  them  bottled 


up.  Tears  started  gushing 
down  my  cheeks,  and  before  I 
knew  it  I  was  sobbing. 

How  had  this  happened?  It 
felt  like  a  bad  dream.  My 
father  was  the  sweetest,  nicest 
man  I  knew.  He  was  naive 
and  fragile.  This  wasn’t  him. 
Even  though  I’d  heard  his 
reasons  for  sobriety  before — 
even  though  I  knew,  in  the 
back  of  my  head,  that  his 
drinking  was  dangerous — it 


still  didn’t  seem  real.  It  didn’t 
seem  possible. 

I  felt  like  my  world  was 
finally  spinning  out  of 
control.  And  this  time,  I 
couldn’t  deny  it.  I  couldn’t 
ignore  it.  And  I  definitely 
couldn’t  escape  it. 

Wesley  didn’t  say 
anything.  He  just  sat  with  me 
in  silence.  I  didn’t  even 
realize  he  was  holding  my 
hand  until  after  the  tears  had 


stopped.  Once  I’d  caught  my 
breath  and  wiped  away  the 
few  salty  drops  from  my 
eyes,  he  opened  his  door  and 
walked  around  to  open  mine. 
He  helped  me  out  of  the  car 
— not  that  I  needed  it,  but  it 
was  still  nice — and  led  me  up 
to  the  porch  with  his  arm 
tight  around  me,  like  the  way 
he’d  guided  me  out  of  my 
house,  keeping  me  close.  As 
if  he  was  afraid  I  might  slip 


away  in  the  darkness  between 
his  car  and  the  front  door. 

Once  we  were  inside, 
Wesley  offered  me  a  drink.  I 
shook  my  head,  and  we  went 
upstairs  like  we  always  did.  I 
sat  on  the  bed,  and  he  sat 
down  next  to  me.  He  wasn’t 
looking  at  me,  but  he  seemed 
to  be  deep  in  thought.  I 
couldn’t  help  wondering  what 
horrible  things  were  on  his 
mind.  I  didn’t  ask.  I  didn’t 


want  to  know. 

“Are  you  all  right?”  he 
asked,  turning  to  face  me 
finally.  “Do  you  need  an  ice 
pack  or  anything?” 

“No,”  I  said.  My  throat 
was  sore  from  crying,  and  my 
words  came  out  kind  of 
croaky.  “It  doesn’t  hurt 
anymore.” 

He  reached  over  and 
brushed  the  hair  away  from 
my  face,  his  fingers  barely 


grazing  my  temple.  “Well,” 
he  said  quietly.  “At  least  now 
I  know.” 

“Know  what?” 

“What  you’re  trying  to 
escape  from.” 

I  didn’t  respond. 

“Why  didn’t  you  tell  me 
that  your  father  has  a  drinking 
problem?”  he  asked. 

“Because  it’s  not  my  place 
to  tell,”  I  said.  “And  it’ll  pass. 
He’s  just  going  through  a 


hard  time  right  now.  He 
hasn’t  had  a  drink  in  eighteen 
years.  Just  since  the  divorce 
papers  came  in. ...  He’ll  get 
better.” 

“You  should  talk  to  him. 
When  he’s  sober,  you  should 
tell  him  that  it’s  getting  out  of 
hand.” 

“Yeah,”  I  scoffed.  “And 
make  him  think  I’m  against 
him,  too?  When  my  mom  has 
just  handed  him  the  divorce 


papers?” 

“You’re  not  against  him, 
Bianca.” 

“Tell  me,  Wesley,  why 
don’t  you  talk  to  your 
parents?”  I  asked.  He  was 
being  a  hell  of  a  hypocrite, 
wasn’t  he?  “Why  don’t  you 
tell  them  that  you’re  lonely? 
That  you  want  them  to  come 
home?  It’s  because  you  don’t 
want  to  upset  them,  right? 
You  don’t  want  them  to 


blame  you  for  their  misery?  If 
I  tell  Dad  he  has  a  problem, 
he’ll  think  I  hate  him.  How 
can  I  hurt  him  more?  He  just 
lost  everything.” 

Wesley  shook  his  head. 
“Not  everything.  He  didn’t 
loseyow,”  he  said.  “At  least 
not  yet.  If  you  don’t  talk  to 
him,  he’ll  just  end  up  driving 
you  away,  and  then  he  will  be 
in  far  worse  pain.” 

“Maybe.” 


Wesley’s  fingers 
continued  to  mb  soothingly 
against  my  temple.  “This 
doesn’t  hurt,  does  it?” 

“Not  at  all.”  Actually,  the 
way  he  was  massaging  my 
skull  felt  pretty  good.  I  sighed 
and  leaned  into  his  hand. 

“The  things  he  said  hurt  way 
more,”  I  murmured. 

I  bit  my  lower  lip.  “You 
know,”  I  said  to  Wesley, 

“I’ve  never  been  called  a 


whore  in  my  life,  and  today 
two  different  people  have 
implied  that  I  am.  What’s 
funny  is,  I’m  pretty  sure 
they’re  right.” 

“That’s  not  funny,” 
Wesley  muttered.  “You’re 
not  a  whore,  Bianca.” 

“Then,  what  am  I?”  I 
demanded,  feeling  suddenly 
angry.  I  pushed  his  hand 
away  from  my  head  and  stood 
up.  “What  am  I?  I’m 


screwing  a  guy  who  isn’t  my 
boyfriend  and  lying  about  it 
to  my  friends. . .  if  they’re 
even  my  friends  anymore.  I 
don’t  even  think  about  it  now, 
whether  this  is  right  or 
wrong!  I’m  a  whore.  Your 
grandma  and  my  dad  both 
think  so,  and  they’re  right.” 

Wesley  stood  up,  his  face 
hard  and  serious.  He  grabbed 
me  by  the  shoulders  and  held 
me  firmly,  forcing  me  to  look 


up  at  him.  “Listen  to  me,”  he 
said.  “You  are  not  a  whore. 
Are  you  listening,  Bianca? 
What  you  are  is  an  intelligent, 
sassy,  sarcastic,  cynical, 
neurotic,  loyal, 
compassionate  girl.  That’s 
what  you  are,  okay?  You’re 
not  a  slut  or  a  whore  or 
anything  remotely  similar. 
Just  because  you  have  some 
secrets  and  some  screwups. . . 
You’re  just  confused. . .  like 


the  rest  of  us.” 

I  stared  at  him,  stunned. 
Was  he  right?  Was  the  rest  of 
the  world  just  as  lost  as  I 
was?  Did  everyone  have  their 
secrets  and  screwups?  They 
must.  I  knew  Wesley  was  just 
as  messed  up  as  me,  so  surely 
the  rest  of  the  world  had  its 
imperfections,  too. 

“Bianca,  whore  is  just  a 
cheap  word  people  use  to  cut 
each  other  down,”  he  said,  his 


voice  softer.  “It  makes  them 
feel  better  about  their  own 
mistakes.  Using  words  like 
that  is  easier  than  really 
looking  into  the  situation.  I 
promise  you,  you’re  not  a 
whore.” 

I  looked  at  him,  into  his 
warm  gray  eyes,  and 
suddenly  understood  what  he 
was  trying  to  tell  me.  The 
message  hidden  beneath  the 
words. 


You  Ye  not  alone. 

Because  he  understood. 

He  understood  how  it  felt  to 
be  abandoned.  He  understood 
the  insults.  Understood  me. 

I  pushed  myself  onto  my 
tiptoes  and  kissed  him — 
really  kissed  him.  It  was  more 
than  just  a  precursor  to  sex. 
There  was  no  war  between 
our  mouths.  My  hips  rested 
lightly  beneath  his,  not 
pressed  tightly.  Our  lips 


moved  in  soft,  perfect 
harmony  with  each  other. 

This  time  it  meant  something. 
What  that  something  was,  I 
didn’t  know  at  the  time,  but  I 
knew  that  there  was  a  real 
connection  between  us.  His 
hands  stroked  gently  through 
my  hair,  his  thumb  grazing 
my  cheek — still  damp  from 
crying  earlier.  And  it  didn’t 
feel  sick  or  twisted  or 
unnatural.  Actually,  it  felt 


like  the  most  natural  thing  in 
the  world. 

I  slid  off  his  shirt,  and  he 
pulled  mine  over  my  head. 
Then  he  laid  me  down  on  the 
bed.  No  rush.  This  time 
things  were  slow  and  earnest. 
This  time  I  wasn’t  looking  for 
an  escape.  This  time  it  was 
about  him.  About  me.  About 
honesty  and  compassion  and 
everything  I’d  never  expected 
to  find  in  Wesley  Rush. 


This  time,  when  our 
bodies  connected,  it  didn’t 
feel  dirty  or  wrong. 

It  felt  horrifyingly  right. 


18 


I  knew  something  was  wrong 
the  instant  I  opened  my  eyes 
the  next  morning. 

The  sky  looked  dull  and 
cold  outside  Wesley’s 
window,  but  I  felt  warm.  So 
warm.  Wesley’s  arm  was 
draped  over  me,  holding  me 


against  his  chest,  and  his  soft, 
rhythmic  breathing  heated  the 
back  of  my  neck.  It  was  so 
peaceful.  So  perfect.  I  felt 
safe  and  content. 

And  that  was  the  problem. 

I  caught  sight  of  a  pink 
sweater  lying  forgotten  in  the 
corner  of  the  room.  It  had 
been  there  for  weeks. 

Property  of  some  nameless 
girl.  One  of  many  Wesley  had 
brought  up  to  his  bedroom. 


Seeing  it,  I  suddenly 
remembered  exactly  whose 
bed  I  was  in.  Who  was 
holding  me. 

I  shouldn’t  have  felt  safe 
or  content.  Not  here.  Not  with 
Wesley.  It  was  wrong.  I 
should  have  been  disgusted.  I 
should  have  been  repulsed.  I 
should  have  wanted  nothing 
more  than  to  push  him  away 
from  me.  What  the  hell  was 
going  on?  What  was  wrong 


with  me? 

And  just  as  I  asked  myself 
the  questions,  the  answers  hit 
me  like  a  tidal  wave.  An  icy 
tidal  wave  that  left  me  wide- 
eyed  and  shocked. 

I  was  jealous  of  the  other 
girls  he  talked  to. 

I  was  willing  to  do 
anything  to  make  him  smile. 

I  felt  safe  and  content  in 
his  arms. 

Oh  my  God ,  I  thought, 


half  panicked.  I’m  in  love 
with  him. 

I  had  to  shake  myself 
then.  No,  no,  no.  Not  love. 
Love  was  a  big  word.  Too 
big.  Love  took  years  upon 
years  to  develop. . .  right?  I 
was  not  in  love  with  Wesley 
Rush. 

But  I  had  feelings  for  him. 
Feelings  other  than  hatred 
and  disgust.  It  was  more  than 
a  crush.  More  than  anything 


I’d  felt  for  Toby  Tucker  over 
the  past  three  years.  Maybe 
even  more  than  I’d  felt  for 
Jake  Gaither  all  those  years 
ago.  It  was  real.  It  was 
powerful. 

And  it  was  terrifying. 

I  had  to  get  out  of  there.  I 
couldn’t  stay.  I  couldn’t  let 
myself  fall  into  this  trap.  No 
matter  how  I  felt  about 
Wesley,  he  would  never  feel 
the  same. 


Because  he  was  Wesley 
Rush. 

And  I  was  the  Duff. 

There  was  no  way  in  hell  I 
was  going  to  torture  myself 
that  way.  I’d  learned  my 
lesson  with  Jake.  Getting  too 
close  just  led  to  getting  hurt, 
and  Wesley  had  plenty  to  hurt 
me  with.  Last  night  he’d  seen 
me  at  my  weakest.  I’d  let  him 
in.  I’d  opened  up.  And  if  I 
didn’t  leave  now,  I’d  pay  the 


price. 

No  matter  where  you  go 
or  what  you  do  to  distract 
yourself,  reality  catches  up 
with  you  eventually.  Mom 
had  said  that  about  herself 
and  Dad. 

A  bitter  smile  spread 
across  my  face  as  I 
reluctantly  crawled  out  of 
Wesley’s  arms.  Mom  had 
been  right.  Wesley  was  my 
distraction.  He  was  supposed 


to  be  my  escape  from 
emotions.  From  all  the  drama. 
And  here  I  was. . .  feeling 
nothing  but  emotions. 

I  crept  around  the  room, 
trying  to  get  dressed  without 
making  any  noise.  After 
yanking  on  my  sweater  and 
jeans,  I  grabbed  my  cell 
phone  and  slipped  out  onto 
the  balcony. 

Before  I  could  talk  myself 
out  of  it,  or  convince  myself 


that  she  wouldn’t  answer,  I 
dialed  Casey’s  cell  phone 
number.  I  knew  she’d  still  be 
pissed  at  me,  but  I  couldn’t 
think  of  any  other  options.  No 
matter  how  mad  she  was,  I 
knew  Casey  would  help  me. 
She’d  help  anyone.  It  was  just 
part  of  her  nature. 

“H’lo?”  she  grunted 
sleepily  after  two  rings. 

Damn,  a  little  voice 
murmured  in  the  back  of  my 


head.  After  all  this  time,  I 
couldn’t  believe  this  was  how 
Casey  would  find  out  my 
secret.  But  I  knew  it  was  for 
the  best.  I  knew  if  I  didn’t 
leave  then,  I  never  would.  I 
knew,  but  I  didn’t  want  to  go. 
I  didn’t  want  to  feel  what  I 
felt.  And  I  really  didn’t  want 
Casey — or  anybody,  for  that 
matter — to  know  about  it. 

“Hello?  Bianca?” 

Too  bad  I  never  got  what  I 


wanted. 

“Hey,  Casey,  I’m  sorry  to 
wake  you  up,  but  can  you  do 
me  a  big  favor?  Please.” 

“B,  are  you  okay?”  she 
demanded,  her  drowsiness 
vanishing.  “What’s  up? 
What’s  wrong?” 

“Can  you  get  your  mom’s 
keys  and  come  pick  me  up?  I 
really  need  a  ride  home.” 

“Home?”  She  sounded 
confused.  Not  a  good  thing 


when  combined  with  fear. 
God,  I  was  going  to  give  the 
poor  girl  ulcers  one  day. 

“You  mean  you  aren’t  at 
home?  You  didn’t  stay  at 
your  place  last  night?” 

“Chill  out,  Casey.  I’m 
fine,”  I  said. 

“Don’t  fucking  tell  me  to 
chill  out,  Bianca,”  she 
snapped.  “You’ve  been  acting 
weird  for  weeks  and  totally 
ignoring  me  every  time  I  tried 


to  talk  to  you.  Now  you’re 
calling  me  early  in  the 
morning  and  telling  me  to 
pick  you  up,  but  I  should  chill 
out?  God,  where  the  hell  are 
you?” 

This  was  the  part  I’d  been 
dreading,  so  I  took  a  deep 
breath  before  answering  her 
question.  “I’m  at  Wesley’s.... 
You  know  the  giant  house  on 


“Yeah,”  Casey  said. 


“Wesley  Rush ’s  place?  I 
know  where  it  is.”  She  was 
curious,  but  she  tried  to  hide 
it  behind  her  anger.  Her 
acting  skills  were  no  better 
than  mine.  “Fine,  I’ll  be  there 
in  ten  minutes.”  And  she 
hung  up. 

I  shut  the  phone  and 
shoved  it  into  my  back 
pocket. 

Ten  minutes.  Just  ten  short 
minutes. 


I  sighed  and  leaned 
against  the  railing  of  the 
balcony.  From  here,  boring- 
ass  Hamilton  looked  like  a 
creepy  ghost  town.  The 
streets  were  empty  this  early 
in  the  morning  (they  were 
never  really  busy,  to  be 
honest),  and  all  the  little  gray- 
roofed  shops  were  closed. 

The  image  wasn’t  helped  by 
the  dull,  sunless  sky  that  left 
everything  under  a  layer  of 


gloom. 

Sunless  gloom.  Go  figure, 
right? 

“You  may  not  be  aware  of 
this,  but  humans  tend  to  sleep 
in  on  Saturdays.” 

I  turned  around  and  found 
Wesley  standing  at  the 
balcony  entrance,  rubbing  his 
eyes  sleepily  with  a  little 
smile  on  his  face.  Despite  the 
chilly  wind,  he  was  wearing 
nothing  but  his  black  boxers. 


Damn,  he  had  an  amazing 
body. . .  but  I  couldn’t  think 
about  that.  I  had  to  end  this. 

“We  need  to  talk.”  I  tried 
to  find  something  to  look  at 
besides  his  hot,  half-naked 
body.  My  feet  seemed  like 
the  best  option. 

“Hmm,”  Wesley  mused, 
running  a  hand  through  his 
messy  curls.  “You  know,  my 
father  says  those  are  the  four 
most  frightening  words  a 


woman  can  say.  He  claims 
that  nothing  good  ever  begins 
with  ‘We  need  to  talk.’ 
You’re  worrying  me  a  little 
here,  Duffy.” 

“We  should  go  inside.” 

“That’s  not  promising.” 

I  followed  him  into  his 
bedroom,  wringing  my  hands 
uncontrollably.  (Sweaty 
palms  are  so  attractive.)  He 
flopped  onto  his  bed  and 
waited  for  me  to  do  the  same, 


but  I  remained  standing.  I 
couldn’t  get  too  comfortable. 
Casey  would  be  there  to  pick 
me  up  in  about  eight  and  a 
half  minutes — I  was  counting 
— so  I  had  to  keep  this  short 
and  sweet. 

Or  just  short.  Nothing 
about  this  felt  sweet  to  me. 

Anxiously,  I  reached  up 
and  scratched  the  back  of  my 
neck.  “Listen,”  I  said. 
“You’re  a  great  guy,  and  I 


appreciate  everything  you’ve 
done  for  me.” 

Why  did  this  sound  so 
much  like  a  breakup?  Didn’t 
you  actually  have  to  be  dating 
someone  to  dump  them? 

“Really?”  Wesley  asked. 
“Since  when?  You’ve  never 
referred  to  me  as  anything 
better  than  a  scumbag.  I  knew 
I’d  grow  on  you  eventually. . . 
but  something  tells  me  I 
should  be  suspicious.” 


“But,”  I  went  on,  ignoring 
him  as  best  I  could.  “I  can’t 
do  this  anymore.  I  think  we 
should  stop,  um,  sleeping 
together.” 

Yep.  Definitely  seemed 
breakup-ish  to  me.  All  I 
needed  to  do  was  throw  in  an 
“It’s  not  you;  it’s  me,”  and  it 
would  be  perfect. 

“Why?”  He  didn’t  sound 
hurt.  Just  surprised. 

It  hurt  me  that  he  didn’t 


sound  hurt. 

“Because  this  isn’t 
working  for  me  anymore,”  I 
said,  sticking  with  the 
traditional  lines  I’d  heard  in 
movies.  They  were  classics 
for  a  reason,  after  all.  “I  just 
don’t  think  this” — I  gestured 
between  us — “is  in  my,  uh. . . 
either  of  our  best  interests.” 

Wesley  narrowed  his  eyes 
at  me.  “Bianca,  does  this  have 
something  to  do  with  what 


happened  last  night?”  he 
asked  seriously.  “If  so,  I  want 
you  to  know  that  you  don’t 
have  to  worry  about — ” 
“That’s  not  it.” 

“What,  then?  You’re  not 
making  sense.” 

I  stared  at  my  shoes.  The 
rubber  edges  were  starting  to 
peel,  but  the  bright  red  fabric 
of  the  Converse  hadn’t  faded 
at  all.  Bright  red.  “I’m  like 
Hester,”  I  whispered,  more  to 


myself  than  to  Wesley. 

“What?” 

I  looked  up  at  him, 
surprised  he’d  heard  me.  “I’m 
like. . .”  I  shook  my  head. 
“Nothing.  We’re  done.  I’m 
done.” 

“Bianca — ” 

Two  quick  honks  from  the 
driveway  saved  me. 

“I — I  have  to  go.” 

I  was  so  focused  on 
getting  the  hell  out  of  that 


house  that  I  didn’t  hear  the 
words  Wesley  yelled  after 
me.  His  voice  simply  faded 
into  the  distance,  where  I 
hoped  to  leave  him  forever.

Casey  revved  the  engine  as  I 
climbed  into  her  mother’s 
ancient  pickup  truck.  Miss 
Waller  (formerly  Mrs.  Blithe; 
she  went  back  to  her  maiden 
name  after  the  divorce)  could 
have  had  a  much  nicer 
vehicle.  Back  when  she  was 


married  to  Casey’s  dad, 
they’d  had  plenty  of  money. 
Mr.  Blithe  had  offered  to  buy 
her  a  Lexus,  but  she’d 
refused.  She  loved  the  rickety 
old  Chevy,  which  she’d 
gotten  her  junior  year  of  high 
school.  Her  daughter,  on  the 
other  hand,  despised  it. 
Especially  since  it  was  the 
only  vehicle  she  got  to  drive. 

Casey  definitely  wouldn’t 
have  turned  her  dad’s  Lexus 


down.  Unfortunately,  Mr. 
Blithe  had  lost  what 
generosity  he  ever  possessed 
after  the  divorce  was 
finalized. 

She  was  gazing  through 
her  windshield  at  the  almost- 
mansion  while  I  pulled  on  my 
seat  belt.  She  had  pink 
pajamas  decorated  with  green 
frogs  on  under  her  jacket,  and 
her  short  hair  stuck  up  in 
every  direction.  Unlike  me, 


Casey  could  make  looking 
like  crap  seem  cute  and  sexy. 
She  didn’t  even  have  to  try. 

“Hi,”  I  said. 

She  looked  over  at  me. 
Her  eyes  swept  across  my 
face — already  searching  for 
telltale  signs  of  trouble — and 
her  forehead  wrinkled.  After 
a  short  staring  contest,  she 
turned  away  and  put  the  truck 
into  drive,  struggling  a  little 
with  the  stick  shift.  “Okay,” 


she  said  as  we  pulled  out  of 
the  driveway.  “What’s  going 
on?  And  don’t  tell  me  things 
are  fine,  because  I  got  my  ass 
up  at  seven  a.m.,  and  I  might 
just  wring  your  neck  if  you 
don’t  give  me  a  real  answer.” 

“Oh,  yes,  because 
resorting  to  threats  always 
gets  me  talking.” 

“Don’t  give  me  that 
bullshit,”  Casey  growled. 
“You’re  just  avoiding  the 


subject,  which  you  do  a  lot. 
That  might  work  with  Jess, 
but  you  should  know  damn 
well  by  now  that  it  won’t 
throw  me  off  one  bit.  Now 
explain.  Start  with  why  I  just 
picked  you  up  at  Wesley’s 
house.” 

“Because  I  stayed  the 
night.” 

“Yeah,  I  figured  that  much 
out  on  my  own.” 

I  bit  my  lip,  not 


completely  sure  why  I  was 
still  hiding  the  truth.  I  mean, 
it  wasn’t  as  if  I  could  keep  the 
truth  from  her  for  much 
longer.  She’d  have  it  pieced 
together  soon  enough,  so  why 
not  just  spill  it  now?  Now 
that  Wesley  and  I  were  over, 
anyway.  Was  lying — or 
withholding,  really — just 
instinctive  now?  After  all 
these  weeks  of  secrecy,  had  I 
developed  a  habit? 


And  if  I  had,  wasn’t  it 
about  time  to  break  it? 

She  sighed  and  the  truck 
slowed  a  little.  “Tell  me  the 
truth,  Bianca,  because  I’m 
pretty  confused  right  now. 
Confused  and  annoyed.  Last 
time  I  checked,  you  hated 
Wesley  Rush.  And  I  mean 
hated” 

“I  did,”  I  said.  “I  still  do. . . 
sort  of.” 

“  ‘Sort  of  ’?  Jesus,  stop 


dancing  around  the  answers. 
Look,  you’ve  been  ditching 
Jess  and  me  for  weeks.  We 
barely  see  you  anymore 
because  you  don’t  do  shit 
with  us.  Jess  won’t  say  it,  but 
she  seriously  thinks  you  don’t 
like  us  anymore.  She’s  upset, 
and  I’m  pissed  because 
you’ve  totally  abandoned  us. 
You’re  always  distracted  and 
zoning  out.  And  you  dance 
around  our  fucking  questions! 


Damn  it,  Bianca,  give  me 
some  answers  here...  please.” 
The  anger  in  her  voice  broke 
into  a  small  plea  of 
desperation.  She  lowered  her 
voice.  “Please,  tell  me  what’s 
going  on  with  you.” 

My  heart  ached  as  guilt 
wrapped  around  my  chest  like 
a  boa  constrictor.  I  let  out  a 
long  breath,  knowing  I 
couldn’t  lie  anymore.  At  least 
not  about  this.  “We’ve  been 


sleeping  together.” 

“Who?  You  and  Wesley?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Since  when?” 

“End  of  January.” 

Casey  was  quiet  for  a  long 
moment.  Then,  after  it  sank 
in,  she  asked,  “If  you  hate 
him,  why  have  you  been 
hooking  up  with  him?” 

“Because. . .  it  made  me 
feel  better.  With  all  of  the 
drama  with  my  parents  and 


then  Jake  showing  up  and 
all. . .  I  just  needed  to  distract 
myself.  I  wanted  to  escape 
from  it  all. . .  you  know,  in  a 
nonsuicidal  way.  Sleeping 
with  Wesley  just  seemed  like 
a  decent  idea  at  the  time.”  I 
stared  out  the  window,  not 
wanting  to  see  the  expression 
on  her  face.  I  was  sure  she’d 
be  disappointed  in  me.  Or,  in 
a  sick  way,  maybe  even 
proud  of  me. 


“So...  is  that  where 
you’ve  been  for  the  past 
month?”  she  asked.  “Is  that 
why  you’ve  been  bailing  on 
us?  You’ve  been  with 
Wesley?” 

“Yeah,”  I  murmured. 
“Every  time  things  got  to  be 
too  much,  he  was  just  there.  I 
could  relieve  the  stress 
without  freaking  you  or 
Jessica  out.  It  seemed  like  a 
decent  idea.  Then  I  was 


addicted. . .  but  it  all  caught 
up  with  me,  and  now  things 
suck  worse  than  ever.” 

“OMG,  are  you 
pregnant?” 

I  gritted  my  teeth  and 
turned  around  to  face  her. 
“No,  Casey,  I’m  not  fucking 
pregnant.”  Was  she  serious? 
“God,  I’m  smart  enough  to 
use  a  condom,  and  I’ve  been 
on  birth  control  for,  like, 
three  freaking  years,  okay?” 


“Okay,  okay,”  Casey  said. 
“You’re  not  pregnant. . .  thank 
God.  But  if  that’s  not  the 
problem,  why  do  things  suck 
worse?” 

“Well,  for  one,  you’re 
pissed  at  me. . .  and  I  like 
Wesley.” 

“Well,  duh,  you  are 
screwing  him.” 

“No,  I  mean. . .”  I  shook 
my  head  and  turned  to  look 
out  the  window  again.  The 


little  suburban  houses  of 
Hamilton  sped  past  us,  simple 
and  clean.  Surrounded  by 
their  innocent  picket  fences.  I 
would  have  killed  to  be 
simple  and  clean  like  these 
little  houses.  Instead,  I  felt 
complicated  and  dirty  and 
tainted.  “I  don’t  like  him,”  I 
explained.  “He  annoys  the 
hell  out  of  me  ninety- six 
percent  of  the  time,  and 
sometimes  I’d  like  nothing 


better  than  to  strangle  him  to 
death.  But  at  the  same  time 
I. . .  I  want  him  to  be  happy.  I 
think  about  him  way  more 
than  I  should,  and  I — ” 

“You  love  him.” 

“No!”  I  shouted,  spinning 
around  to  face  her.  “No,  no, 
no!  I  do  not  love  him,  okay? 
Love  is  rare  and  hard  to  find 
and  takes  years  upon  years  to 
develop.  Teenagers  don’t  fall 
in  love.  I  don’t  love  Wesley.” 


“Fine,”  Casey  said.  “But 
you  have  feelings  for  him, 
right?” 

“Yeah.” 

She  glanced  at  me  before 
turning  back  to  the  road,  half 
grinning.  “I  knew  it.  I 
mean. . .  all  those  jokes  I 
made  about  it  were  just 
teasing,  but  I  knew  something 
would  happen  after  you 
kissed  him.” 

“Shut  up,”  I  muttered. 


“This  sucks.” 

“Why?” 

“Why  what?” 

“Why  is  it  a  bad  thing?  So 
what  if  you  have  feelings  for 
him.  Isn’t  that  supposed  to  be 
great  and  exciting  and  give 
you  butterflies  in  your  tummy 
or  whatever?” 

“No,”  I  said.  “It’s  not 
great  or  exciting.  It’s  terrible. 
It’s  excruciating.” 

“But  why?” 


“Because  he’ll  never  like 
me  back!”  God,  wasn’t  it 
obvious?  Couldn’t  she  put 
two  and  two  together?  “He’ll 
never  care  about  me  that  way, 
Casey.  I’m  wasting  my  time 
even  thinking  that  it’s 
possible.” 

“Why  won’t  he  like  you 
back?”  she  asked. 

Did  she  have  a  million 
questions  or  what?  “Stop.” 

“No,  I’m  being  serious, 


B,”  Casey  pushed.  “I’m 
pretty  sure  you  can’t  read 
minds  or  see  into  the  future, 
so  I  don’t  see  how  you  know 
that  he  won’t  ever  like  you. 
Why  wouldn’t  he?” 

“You  don’t  like  me  very 
much  right  now,”  I  pointed 
out. 

“I’ll  get  over  it,”  she  said. 
“Well,  eventually.  But 
seriously,  what’s  stopping 
Wesley  from  liking  you 


back?” 

“I’m  the  Duff.” 

“Sorry.  The  what?” 
“Duff.” 

“Is  that  even  a  word?” 
“The  designated  ugly  fat 
friend,”  I  sighed.  “The 
unattractive  girl  in  the  group. 
That’s  me.” 

“That’s  stupid.” 

“Is  it?”  I  snapped.  “Is  it 
really  that  stupid,  Casey? 
Look  at  you.  Look  at  Jessica. 


Y ou  two  look  like  you 
jumped  out  of  an  issue  of 
Teen  Vogue.  I  can’t  compete 
with  that.  So,  yeah,  I’m  the 
fucking  Duff.” 

“You  are  not.  Who  told 
you  that?” 

Wesley.” 

You’re  shitting  me!” 
;Nope.” 

Before  or  after  you 
fucked  him?” 

“Before.”

“Well  then,  he  didn’t 
mean  it,”  Casey  said.  “He’s 
been  sleeping  with  you,  right? 
So  he  must  find  you 
attractive.” 

I  snorted.  “Look  who 
you’re  talking  about,  Casey. 
Wesley  isn’t  particularly 
picky  when  it  comes  to  sex.  I 
could  look  like  a  gorilla,  and 
he  still  wouldn’t  hesitate  to 
fuck  me,  but  dating  me  is  a 
totally  different  situation.  He 


wouldn’t  even  date  a  girl  on 
the  Skinny  Squad — ” 

“I  really  hate  it  when  you 
call  us  that.” 

“ — but  me?  He  would 
never  be  the  boyfriend  of  a 
Duff.” 

“Seriously,  Bianca,” 
Casey  said.  “You  are  not  the 
Duff.  If  any  of  us  is  the  Duff, 
it’s  me.” 

“Funny.” 

“I’m  not  joking,”  she 


insisted.  “I’m  still  mad  at 
you,  so  why  would  I  go  out  of 
my  way  to  be  nice?  I  mean, 
I’m  like  freaking  Bigfoot.  I’m 
six  one  now!  Most  guys  have 
to  look  up  to  see  my  face,  and 
no  guy  likes  being  shorter 
than  a  chick.  At  least  you’re 
cute  and  petite.  I’d  kill  to  be 
your  height. . .  and  to  have 
your  eyes.  You  have  way 
prettier  eyes  than  me.” 

I  didn’t  say  anything.  I 


was  sure  she’d  gone  insane. 
How  the  hell  could  she  be  the 
Duff?  Even  in  her  frog 
pajamas  she  looked  like  she’d 
just  stepped  off  the  set  of 
America ’s  Next  Top  Model. 

“If  Wesley  can’t  see  how 
adorable  you  are,  he  doesn’t 
deserve  you,”  she  said. 

“You  just  need  to  move 
on.  Put  Wesley  out  of  your 
mind.” 

Yeah,  right.  Move  on  to 


who?  Who  would  want  me? 

Nobody. 

But  I  couldn’t  say  that  to 
Casey.  It  would  probably  just 
start  another  stupid  fight,  and 
we  hadn’t  really  finished  the 
first  one  yet,  so  I  just  nodded. 

“So. . .  what  about  the 
Tucker  kid?” 

I  looked  at  her,  surprised. 
“Toby?  What  about  him?” 

“You’ve  had  a  crush  on 
him  forever,”  she  reminded 


me.  “And  I  saw  you  all  over 
him  in  the  cafeteria  yesterday 

“He  hugged  me,”  I 
interjected.  “That  is  hardly 
me  being  all  over  him.” 

She  rolled  her  eyes.  God,  I 
was  really  rubbing  off  on  her. 
“Whatever.  The  point  is,  you 
were  getting  cozy  with  Toby, 
but  now  you’re  suddenly  in 


I  shot  her  a  warning  glare. 


“ — you  suddenly  like 
Wesley,”  she  finished. 

“What’s  your  point?”  I 
asked. 

“I  don’t  know,”  she 
sighed.  “It’s  just...  I  feel  like 
you’ve  kept  so  much  from 
me.  Like  so  much  has 
changed  so  fast  with  you.  I 
feel  really  in  the  dark  right 
now.” 

More  guilt.  Great.  She 
was  laying  it  on  thick  today, 


but  I  guess  I  deserved  it. 

“Not  that  much  has 
changed,”  I  assured  her.  “I 
still  have  a  crush  on  Toby. . . 
not  that  it  matters.  We’re  just 
friends.  He  hugged  me 
yesterday  because  he  got  into 
the  college  he  wanted  and 
was  really  happy.  I  wish  it 
had  been  more,  but  it  wasn’t. 
And  the  thing  with  Wesley  is 
just...  it’s  stupid.  It’s  over. 
We  can  pretend  it  never 


happened.  I’d  prefer  that, 
actually.” 

“What  about  your  parents? 
The  divorce?  You  haven’t 
even  brought  it  up  since  the 
day  after  Valentine’s.” 

“Everything’s  fine,”  I  lied. 
“The  divorce  is  still 
happening.  My  parents  are 
fine.” 

She  gave  me  a  skeptical 
look  before  turning  back  to 
the  road.  She  knew  I  was  full 


of  shit,  but  for  once  she  didn’t 
push  it.  Finally,  after  a  long 
moment,  she  spoke  again. 
Luckily,  she  changed  the 
subject. 

“Okay.  So  where  the  hell 
is  your  car?” 

“At  school,”  I  said.  “The 
battery’s  dead.” 

“That  blows.  I  guess 
you’ll  have  to  get  your  dad  to 
go  fix  it.” 

“Yeah,”  I  muttered.  If  I 


can  get  him  sober  for  more 
than  ten  seconds. 

There  was  a  long  silence. 
After  a  few  minutes,  I 
decided  to  swallow  the  little 
pride  I  had  left.  “I’m  sorry  I 
called  you  a  bitch  yesterday.” 

“You  should  be.  You  also 
called  me  a  preppy 
cheerleader  snob.” 

“Sorry.  Are  you  still  mad 
at  me?” 

“Yeah,”  she  said.  “I  mean, 


not  as  much  as  I  was 
yesterday,  but. . .  it  really  hurt, 
Bianca.  Jess  and  I  have  been 
so  worried  about  you,  and 
you  barely  talk  to  either  of  us 
anymore.  I  kept  asking  and 
asking  if  you  wanted  to  go 
out,  and  you  totally  blew  me 
off.  Then  I  saw  you  talking  to 
Toby  when  you  were 
supposed  to  be  talking  to  me, 
and. . .  I  was  kind  of  jealous. 
Not  in  a  creepy  way,  but. . . 


I’m  supposed  to  be  your  best 
friend,  you  know?  It  felt  like 
you  just  tossed  me  aside.  And 
now  it  really  bothers  me  that 
you  started  sleeping  with 
Wesley  instead  of  just  talking 
to  me.” 

“Sorry,”  I  mumbled. 

“Stop  saying  that.  Don’t 
just  be  sorry,”  she  said. 

“Sorry  doesn’t  change  the 
future.  Next  time,  think  about 
me.  And  Jess,  too.  We  need 


you,  B.  And  just  remember 
that  we’re  here  for  you,  and 
we  care  about  you. . .  for  some 
ungodly  reason.” 

I  cracked  a  little  smile. 

“I’ll  remember.” 

“Just  don’t  abandon  me 
again,  okay?”  The  words 
came  out  in  a  weak  murmur. 
“Even  with  Jess,  I  was  really 
lonely  without  you. . .  and  I 
didn’t  have  anyone  cool  to 
drive  me  around.  Do  you 


know  how  much  it  sucks  to 
have  Vikki  as  your  chauffer? 
She  almost  hit  some  poor  old 
dude  on  a  bike  the  other  day. 
Did  I  tell  you  that  story?” 

We  drove  around 
Hamilton  for  a  while,  just 
wasting  gas  and  catching  up 
on  what  we’d  missed.  Casey 
had  a  crush  on  a  basketball 
player.  I  was  acing  English. 
Nothing  too  personal.  Casey 
knew  my  secret  now — or  part 


of  it — and  she  wasn’t  mad  at 
me  anymore. . .  well,  not  that 
mad  at  me.  She  assured  me  I 
had  a  lot  of  groveling  to  do 
before  we  were  totally  good 
again. 

We  drove  around  until  her 
mom  called  at  ten,  demanding 
to  know  where  her  truck  was, 
and  Casey  had  to  take  me 
home. 

“Are  you  going  to  tell 
Jessica  about  this?”  she  asked 


quietly  as  she  turned  onto  my 
street.  “About  Wesley?” 

“I  don’t  know.”  I  took  a 
deep  breath,  deciding  that 
keeping  secrets  wasn’t  the 
best  idea.  It  had  only  fucked 
things  up  so  far.  “Look,  you 
can  tell  her.  Tell  her 
everything  if  you  want.  But  I 
don’t  want  to  talk  about  it.  I 
just  kind  of  want  to  forget 
about  this  if  I  can.” 

“I  understand,”  Casey 


said.  “I  think  she  should 
know.  I  mean,  she  is  our  best 
friend. . .  but  I’ll  tell  her 
you’re  moving  on.  Because 
that’s  what  you’re  doing, 
right?” 

“Right,”  I  murmured. 

I  couldn’t  help  feeling 
anxious  when  she  pulled  into 
my  driveway.  I  stared  at  the 
oak  front  door,  at  the 
shuttered  windows  that 
looked  in  on  my  living  room, 


and  at  our  simple,  clean, 
picket- fenced  yard.  I’d  never 
realized  what  a  mask  my 
family  lived  behind. 

Then  I  thought  of  Dad. 

“I ’ll  see  you  Monday,”  I 
said,  looking  away  so  she 
couldn’t  see  the  worry  on  my 
face. 

Then  I  slid  out  of  the  truck 
and  started  walking  toward 
my  house. 


20 


I  was  standing  on  the  porch 
before  I  realized  I  didn’t  have 
my  keys.  Wesley  had  pulled 
me  from  the  house  so  quickly 
the  night  before  that  I  hadn’t 
been  able  to  grab  my  purse. 

So  I  found  myself  knocking 
on  my  own  front  door,  hoping 


Dad  was  awake  to  let  me  in. 

Fearing,  dreading, 
remembering. 

I  took  a  step  back  as  the 
knob  turned  and  the  door 
swung  open.  There  stood 
Dad,  his  eyes  red  and  deeply 
circled  behind  his  glasses.  He 
looked  really  pale,  like  he’d 
been  sick,  and  I  could  see  his 
hand  shaking  on  the 
doorknob.  “Bianca.” 

He  didn’t  smell  like 


whiskey. 

I  let  out  a  breath  I  hadn’t 
realized  I  was  holding.  “Hi, 
Dad.  I,  um,  left  my  keys 
inside  last  night,  so. . .” 

He  moved  slowly  forward, 
like  he  was  afraid  I  might  run 
away.  Then  he  wrapped  his 
arms  around  me,  pulled  me 
into  his  chest,  and  buried  his 
face  in  my  hair.  We  stood 
there  together  for  a  long 
moment,  and  when  he  finally 


spoke,  I  could  tell  the  words 
came  through  sobs.  “I’m  so, 
so  sorry.” 

“I  know,”  I  murmured  into 
his  shirt. 

And  I  was  crying,  too. 

Dad  and  I  talked  more  that 
day  than  we  had  in  seventeen 
years.  Not  that  we  weren’t 
close  before.  It’s  just  that 
neither  of  us  is  very 
expressive.  We  didn’t  share 


our  thoughts  or  feelings  or  do 
any  of  that  stuff  they  tell  you 
is  important  on  those  public 
service  announcements  you 
see  on  Nickelodeon.  When 
we  ate  dinner  together,  we 
were  always  in  front  of  the 
TV,  and  there  was  no  way 
either  of  us  would  interrupt 
the  program  with  lame  small 
talk.  That’s  just  how  we  were. 

But  that  day  we  talked. 

We  talked  about  his  work. 


We  talked  about  my 
grades. 

We  talked  about  Mom. 

“She’s  really  not  coming 
back,  is  she?”  Dad  took  off 
his  glasses  and  rubbed  his 
face  with  both  hands.  We 
were  sitting  on  the  couch.  For 
once,  the  television  was  off. 
Ours  were  the  only  voices 
that  filled  the  room.  It  was  a 
good  kind  of  semi-silence,  yet 
scary  at  the  same  time. 


“No,  Daddy,”  I  said, 
bravely  reaching  out  to 
squeeze  his  hand.  “She’s  not. 
This  just  isn’t  the  right  place 
for  her  anymore.” 

He  nodded.  “I  know.  I’ve 
known  for  a  long  time  that 
she  wasn’t  happy. . .  maybe 
even  before  she  knew.  I  just 
hoped — ” 

“That  she’d  change  her 
mind?”  I  offered.  “I  think  she 
wanted  to.  That’s  why  she 


kept  leaving  and  coming 
back,  you  know?  She  didn’t 
want  to  face  the  truth.  She 
didn’t  want  to  admit  that  she 
wanted  a” — I  paused  at  the 
next  word — “divorce.” 

Divorce  was  just  so  final. 
More  than  a  fight.  More  than 
a  separation  or  a  long 
speaking  tour.  It  meant  their 
marriage — their  life  together 
— was  really  and  truly 
finished. 


“Well,”  he  sighed, 
squeezing  my  hand  back.  “I 
guess  we  were  both  running 
away  in  different  ways.” 

“What  do  you  mean?” 

Dad  shook  his  head. 
“Your  mother  took  a 
Mustang.  I  took  a  whiskey 
bottle.”  He  reached  up  and 
readjusted  his  glasses,  an 
unconscious  habit — he 
always  did  it  when  he  was 
making  a  point.  “I  was  so 


devastated  by  what  your 
mother  did  to  me  that  I  forgot 
how  horrible  drinking  is.  I 
forgot  to  look  on  the  bright 
side.” 

“Dad,”  I  said,  “I  don’t 
think  there  is  a  bright  side  to 
divorce.  It’s  a  pretty  sucky 
thing  all  around.” 

He  nodded.  “Maybe  that’s 
true,  but  there  are  a  lot  of 
bright  sides  to  my  life.  I  have 
a  job  I  like,  a  nice  house  in  a 


good  neighborhood,  and  a 
wonderful  daughter.” 

I  rolled  my  eyes.  “Oh 
God,”  I  muttered.  “Don’t  go 
all  Lifetime  movie  on  me. 
Seriously.” 

“I’m  sorry,”  he  said, 
smiling.  “But  I  mean  it.  A  lot 
of  people  would  kill  for  my 
life,  but  I  didn’t  even 
consider  that.  I  took  it — and 
you — for  granted.  I’m  so,  so 
sorry  for  that,  Bumblebee.” 


I  wanted  to  look  away 
when  I  saw  the  tears 
glistening  at  the  corners  of  his 
eyes,  but  I  forced  myself  to 
focus  only  on  him.  I’d  been 
turning  away  from  the  truth 
for  too  long. 

He  apologized  multiple 
times  for  everything  that  had 
happened  over  the  past  few 
weeks.  He  promised  me  he’d 
start  going  to  weekly 
Alcoholics  Anonymous 


meetings  again,  to  go  back  on 
the  wagon,  to  call  his  sponsor 
again.  And  then  we  poured 
every  single  bottle  of  whiskey 
and  beer  down  the  drain 
together,  both  of  us  eager  for 
a  clean  slate. 

“Is  your  head  all  right?” 
he  asked  me  about  a  million 
times  that  day. 

“It’s  fine,”  I  kept  telling 
him. 

He  always  shook  his  head 


and  murmured  more 
apologies  for  slapping  me. 
For  saying  what  he  had.  Then 
he’d  hug  me. 

Seriously,  a  million  times 
that  day. 

Around  midnight,  I  joined 
him  in  his  nightly  ritual  of 
turning  out  the  lights. 
“Bumblebee,”  he  said  as  the 
kitchen  went  dark.  “I  want 
you  to  thank  your  friend  next 
time  you  see  him.” 


“My  friend?” 

“Yeah.  The  boy  who  was 
with  you  last  night.  What’s 
his  name?” 

“Wesley,”  I  muttered. 

“Right,”  Dad  said.  “Well, 

I  deserved  it.  He  was  brave  to 
do  what  he  did.  I  don’t  know 
what’s  going  on  between  you 
two,  but  I’m  glad  you  have  a 
friend  who’s  willing  to  stand 
up  for  you.  So  please  tell  him 
I  said  thanks.” 


“Sure.”  I  turned  and 
walked  up  the  stairs  to  my 
bedroom,  praying  that 
wouldn’t  be  anytime  soon. 

“But  Bianca?”  He  winced 
and  rubbed  his  jaw.  “Next 
time  tell  him  he  should  feel 
free  to  write  a  strongly 
worded  letter  first.  Hell  of  an 
arm  on  that  kid.” 

I  smiled  in  spite  of  myself. 
“There  won’t  be  a  next  time,” 
I  told  him,  taking  the  last  few 


steps  and  heading  to  my 
bedroom. 

Both  my  parents  were 
facing  reality,  giving  up  their 
distractions.  Now  it  was  my 
turn,  and  that  meant  quitting 
Wesley.  Unfortunately,  there 
were  no  weekly  meetings,  no 
sponsors,  or  twelve-step 
programs  for  what  I  was 
addicted  to. 


21 


I  was  pretty  sure  Wesley 
wouldn’t  approach  me  at 
school.  Why  would  he?  It 
wasn’t  like  he’d  miss  me. . . 
even  if  I  really,  really  wanted 
him  to.  He  wasn’t  losing 
anything.  He  had  plenty  of 
replacement  girls  ready  and 


willing  to  fill  any  gaps  I 
might  have  left  in  his 
schedule.  So  there  was  no 
need  for  an  avoidance  plan  on 
Monday  morning. 

Except  that  I  didn’t  even 
want  to  see  him.  If  I  had  to 
look  at  him  day  after  day,  I 
could  never  hope  to  forget 
about  him.  I  could  never  hope 
to  move  on.  For  this  situation, 
I  did  need  a  plan,  and  I  had 
one  all  lined  up. 


Step  one:  keep  distracted 
in  the  hallway  in  case  he 
passed  me. 

Step  two:  stay  busy  in 
English  and  never  look  over 
at  his  side  of  the  classroom. 

Step  three:  speed  out  of 
the  parking  lot  in  the 
afternoon  so  I  didn’t  run  into 
him. 

Dad  made  step  three 
possible  by  fixing  my  car 
Sunday,  so  I  was  sure  I  could 


keep  from  seeing  Wesley.  In 
a  matter  of  weeks,  I’d  be  able 
to  put  our  relationship — or 
lack  thereof — out  of  my 
mind.  If  not,  well,  we’d 
graduate  in  May  and  I’d 
never  have  to  look  at  that 
cocky  smirk  ever  again. 

That  was  the  theory, 
anyway. 

But  by  the  time  the  final 
bell  rang  on  Monday,  I  knew 
my  plan  sucked  ass.  Not 


looking  at  Wesley  didn’t 
necessarily  equal  not  thinking 
of  Wesley.  In  fact,  I  spent 
most  of  my  day  thinking 
about  not  looking  at  him. 
Then  I  just  thought  about  all 
the  reasons  I  shouldn’t  be 
thinking  of  him.  It  never 
freaking  ended!  Nothing 
seemed  to  distract  me. 

Until  Tuesday  afternoon. 

I  was  on  my  way  to  lunch 
after  an  unbearably  long  AP 


government  class  when 
something  happened  that 
gave  me  just  the  distraction  I 
needed.  Something 
unbelievable  and  shocking. 
Something  pretty  damn 
awesome. 

Toby  fell  into  step  with 
me  in  the  hallway.  “Hey,”  he 
said. 

“Hi.”  I  did  my  best  to 
sound  at  least  halfway 
pleasant.  “What’s  up, 


Harvard  Boy?” 

Toby  grinned  and  looked 
down,  shuffling  his  feet.  “Not 
much,”  he  said.  “Just  trying 
to  decide  what  to  write  about 
for  the  editorial  assignment. 
Mr.  Chaucer  wasn’t  very 
specific.  What  are  you  going 
to  write  yours  about?” 

“I’m  not  sure,”  I  admitted. 
“I’m  thinking  of  doing  it  on 
gay  marriage.” 

“Supporting  or 


opposing?” 

“Oh,  definitely 
supporting.  I  mean,  the 
government  has  no  right  to 
dictate  who  can  and  can’t 
publicly  declare  their  love  for 
each  other.” 

“How  romantic  of  you,” 
Toby  said. 

I  snorted.  “Hardly.  I’m  not 
romantic  at  all,  but  it’s  basic 
logic.  Denying  homosexuals 
the  right  to  marriage  infringes 


on  their  liberty  and  equality. 
Pretty  screwed  up.” 

“My  thoughts  exactly,” 
Toby  agreed.  “It  seems  we 
have  a  lot  in  common.” 

“I  guess  we  do.” 

We  walked  for  a  couple  of 
seconds  in  silence  before  he 
asked,  “So,  do  you  have  any 
plans  for  prom?” 

“No,”  I  told  him.  “I’m  not 
going.  Why  pay  two  hundred 
bucks  for  a  dress,  thirty  for  a 


ticket,  forty  for  hair  and 
makeup,  and  a  handful  more 
for  dinner,  where  all  you  can 
have  is  a  salad  with  no 
dressing  because  you  have  to 
avoid  getting  gunk  on  the 
poufy  dress?  It’s  kind  of 
ridiculous.” 

“I  see,”  Toby  said.  “That’s 
a  little  unfortunate. . ..  I  was 
kind  of  hoping  you’d  go  with 
me.” 

Okay,  so  I  hadn’t  seen  that 


coming.  At  all.  Ever.  Toby 
Tucker,  the  boy  I’d  crushed 
on  for  years,  wanted  to  ask 
me  to  prom?  Oh  my  God.  Oh 
my  God.  And  I’d  totally 
bashed  the  whole  institution 
of  high  school  dances  like  an 
opinionated  idiot.  I’d 
practically  rejected  him 
without  even  meaning  to.  Oh, 
shit.  I  was  a  moron.  A 
complete  moron.  And  now  I 
was  at  a  loss  for  words.  What 


did  I  say?  Did  I  apologize  or 
take  it  back  or — 

“But  it’s  fine  if  you  feel 
that  way,”  Toby  said.  “I’ve 
always  thought  prom  was  a 
pointless  rite  of  passage,  so 
we’re  on  the  same  page.” 
“Uh,  yeah,”  I  said  lamely. 
Oh,  someone  fucking 
shoot  me  right  now! 

“But,”  Toby  pressed,  “are 
you  opposed  to  regular  dates? 
Ones  without  poufy  dresses 


or  crappy  salads?” 

“No.  I  don’t  have  a 
problem  with  those.” 

My  head  was  spinning. 
Toby  wanted  me  to  go  on  a 
date  with  him.  A  date!  I 
hadn’t  been  on  a  real  date 
since. . .  Hell,  I’d  never  been 
on  a  real  date.  Unless  you 
counted  making  out  with  Jake 
in  the  back  of  a  movie  theater 
a  date. 

I  didn’t. 


But  why?  Why  would 
Toby  want  to  go  on  a  date 
with  me?  I  was  the  Duff. 
Duffs  don’t  get  dates.  Not 
real  ones.  Yet  Toby  was 
defying  the  odds.  Maybe  he 
was  a  bigger  man  than  most. 
Just  like  how  I’d  always 
imagined  him  in  my  stupid, 
girly,  midclass  daydreams. 
Not  shallow.  Not  conceited. 
Not  cocky  or  vain.  A  perfect 
gentleman. 


“That’s  good,”  he  said. 

“In  that  case. . .”  I  could  tell 
he  was  nervous.  His  cheeks 
were  turning  pink,  and  he  was 
staring  at  his  shoes  and 
playing  with  his  glasses. 
“Friday?  Would  you  like  to 
go  out  with  me  on  Friday 
night?” 

“I’d  like...” 

Then  the  inevitable 
happened.  I  thought  of  the 
douche  bag.  The  playboy. 


The  womanizer.  The  one 
person  who  could  min  this 
moment  for  me.  Yes,  I  had  a 
cmsh  on  Toby  Tucker.  How 
could  I  not?  He  was  sweet 
and  charming  and  smart. . . 
but  my  feelings  for  Wesley 
were  way  beyond  that.  I’d 
skipped  the  cmsh  kiddie  pool 
and  jumped  right  into  the 
deep,  shark-infested  ocean  of 
emotions.  And,  if  you’ll 
forgive  the  dramatic 


metaphor,  I  was  a  lousy 
swimmer. 

But  Casey  had  told  me  to 
move  on,  and  here  Toby  was, 
tossing  me  a  float  and 
offering  to  save  me  from 
drowning.  I’d  be  stupid  not  to 
accept.  God  only  knew  how 
long  it  might  be  before 
another  rescue  party  came 
along. 

And,  come  on,  Toby  was 
adorable. 


“I’d  like  that,”  I  said, 
hoping  my  pause  hadn’t 
freaked  him  out  too  much. 

“Great.”  He  sounded 
relieved.  “I’ll  pick  you  up  at 
seven  Friday  night.” 

“Cool.” 

We  separated  in  the 
cafeteria,  and  I  think  I 
skipped — yeah,  skipped  like  a 
little  kid — to  the  lunch  table, 
my  bad  mood  totally 
forgotten. 


And  it  stayed  forgotten. 

For  the  rest  of  that  week,  I 
didn’t  think  about  how  I 
shouldn’t  be  thinking  of 
Wesley.  I  didn’t  think  of 
Wesley  at  all.  Not  once.  My 
brain  was  too  full  of  things 
like  What  should  I  wear?  and 
How  should  I fix  my  hair?  All 
the  stuff  I’d  never  worried 
about  before.  Talk  about 
surreal. 

But  those  were  the  things 


that  Casey  and  Jessica  were 
experts  on,  so  they  came 
home  with  me  on  Friday 
afternoon,  and  they  were 
eager  to  make  me  their  own 
personal  Barbie  doll.  If  I 
hadn’t  been  so  nervous  about 
this  date,  I  would  have  been 
horrified,  my  feminist 
sensibilities  offended  at  their 
preening  and  squealing. 

They  forced  me  into,  like, 
twenty  different  outfits  (all  of 


which  I  hated)  before 
deciding  on  one.  I  wound  up 
in  a  knee-length  black  skirt 
and  a  low-cut  turquoise 
blouse,  cut  just  low  enough 
that  you  could  make  out  the 
curve  of  my  tiny  boobs.  Then 
they  spent  the  rest  of  the  time 
using  a  flatiron  on  my 
unwilling  hair.  It  took  them 
two  hours — that’s  no 
exaggeration,  by  the  way — to 
get  it  all  straight. 


It  was  already  six-fifty 
when  they  placed  me  in  front 
of  the  mirror  to  examine  their 
work. 

“Perfect,”  Casey 
announced. 

“Cute!”  Jessica  agreed. 

“See,  B,”  Casey  said.  “All 
of  that  Duff  shit  is  ridiculous. 
You  look  freaking  smoking 
right  now.” 

“What  Duff  shi — uh, 
stuff?"  Jessica  asked. 


“Nothing,”  I  said. 

“B  thinks  she’s  the  ugly 
one.” 

“What?”  Jessica  cried. 
“Bianca,  do  you  really  think 
that?” 

“It’s  not  a  big  deal.” 

“She  does,”  Casey  said. 
“She  told  me  so.” 

“But  you’re  not,  Bianca,” 
Jessica  insisted.  “How  could 
you  think  that?” 

“Jessica,  don’t  worry 


about  it,”  I  said.  “It’s  no  big 

“I  know,”  Casey  said. 
“Isn’t  it  stupid?  Isn’t  she  hot, 
Jess?” 

“She’s  super-hot.” 

“See,  B.  You’re  super- 
hot.” 

I  sighed.  “Thanks,  guys.” 
Time  for  a  subject  change. 
“So,  um,  how  are  you  getting 
home?  I  can’t  take  you  if 
Toby  is  picking  me  up  in  ten 


minutes.  Are  your  parents 
coming  to  get  you?” 

“Oh,  no,”  Jessica  said. 
“We  aren’t  leaving.” 

“What?” 

“We’ll  be  here  when  you 
get  back  from  your  date,” 
Casey  informed  me.  “Then 
we’re  having  an  ultra-girly, 
tell-all  slumber  party  in  honor 
of  our  B’s  first  big  date.” 

“Yep,”  Jessica  chirped. 

I  gawked  at  them.  “You’re 


not  serious.” 

“Do  we  look  like  we’re 
kidding?”  Casey  asked. 

“But  what  will  you  do 
while  I’m  gone?  Won’t  you 
be  bored  or  whatever?” 

“You  have  TV,”  Jessica 
reminded  me. 

“And  that’s  all  we  really 
need,”  Casey  said.  “We 
already  called  your  dad.  You 
don’t  have  a  choice.” 

The  doorbell  rang  before  I 


could  argue  any  further,  and 
my  friends  practically  pushed 
me  down  the  stairs.  Once  we 
were  in  the  living  room,  they 
started  straightening  my  skirt 
and  adjusting  the  collar  of  my 
shirt,  attempting  to  maximize 
the  amount  of  cleavage  I  was 
showing. 

“You’re  going  to  have 
such  a  good  time,”  Casey 
sighed  happily,  pushing  some 
hair  behind  my  ear.  “You’ll 


be  over  Wesley  in  no  time.” 

My  stomach  clenched. 

“Shh. . .  Casey. . Jessica 
murmured.  I  knew  Casey  had 
told  her  the  whole  story  by 
now,  but  she  hadn’t  said 
anything  to  me  about  it, 
which  I  appreciated.  I  really 
just  wanted  to  keep  my  mind 
as  far  from  Wesley  as 
possible. 

I  hadn’t  spoken  to  him 
since  the  morning  I’d  left  his 


house.  He’d  tried  to  talk  to 
me  once  or  twice  after 
English,  though.  I  just 
avoided  him,  starting  up 
conversations  with  Jessica  or 
Casey  and  rushing  out  of  the 
class  as  fast  as  I  could. 

“OMG,  sorry,”  Casey 
said,  biting  her  lip.  “I  didn’t 
think.”  She  cleared  her  throat 
awkwardly  and  scratched  the 
back  of  her  head,  ruffling  her 
short  hair. 


“Have  fun!”  Jessica 
chimed,  forcing  the 
uncomfortable  pause  away. 
“But,  you  know,  not  too 
much  fun.  My  parents  might 
not  like  you  so  much  if  I  have 
to  bail  you  out  of  jail.” 

I  laughed.  Only  Jessica 
could  save  us  from  these 
awkward  moments  with  such 
bubbly  grace. 

I  looked  at  Casey,  and  I 
could  see  a  spark  of  fear  in 


her  eye.  She  wanted  me  to 
move  on  after  Wesley,  but  I 
knew  she  was  worried. 
Worried  I’d  leave  her  behind 
again.  Worried  Toby  would 
replace  her. 

But  she  had  nothing  to  be 
afraid  of.  This  was  totally 
different  from  my 
relationship  with  Wesley.  I 
wasn’t  running  anymore.  Not 
from  reality.  Not  from  my 
friends.  Not  from  anything. 


I  smiled  to  reassure  her. 

“Go!  Go!”  Jessica 
squealed,  her  blond  ponytail 
swinging  as  she  bounced 
excitedly. 

“Yeah,”  Casey  said, 
smiling  back  at  me.  “Don’t 
keep  the  boy  waiting.” 

They  shoved  me  forward 
and  disappeared  back  upstairs 
in  a  fit  of  giggles  and 
whispers. 

“Freaks,”  I  muttered, 


shaking  my  head  and  fighting 
a  small  giggle.  I  took  a  deep 
breath  and  pulled  open  the 
door.  “Hey,  Toby.” 

He  stood  on  my  front 
porch,  looking  as  cute  as 
always  in  his  navy  blazer  and 
khaki  pants.  He  looked  like  a 
Kennedy.  With  a  bowl  cut. 

He  gave  me  a  big  boyish 
smile  that  showed  off  all  his 
ivory  teeth.  “Hi,”  he  said, 
shifting  to  stand  in  front  of 


me.  He’d  been  waiting  off  to 
one  side  of  the  door.  “Sorry.  I 
decided  to  wait.  I  heard 
giggling.” 

“Oh,”  I  glanced  over  my 
shoulder.  “Yeah.  Sorry  about 
that.” 

“Wow.  You  look 
beautiful,  Bianca.” 

“No,  I  don’t,”  I  said, 
totally  embarrassed.  No  guy 
but  my  dad  had  ever  said  that 
to  me  before. 


“Of  course  you  do,”  he 
said.  “Why  would  I  lie?” 

“I  don’t  know.”  Oh,  wow, 
I  was  lame.  Why  couldn’t  I 
just  take  a  compliment?  What 
if  I  sent  him  running  before 
we  even  started  the  date? 

God,  that  would  be  shitty.  I 
cleared  my  throat  and  tried  to 
look  like  I  wasn’t  inwardly 
slapping  myself. 

“So  are  you  ready  to  go?” 
Toby  asked. 


“Yeah.” 

I  stepped  outside  and  shut 
the  door  behind  me.  Toby 
took  my  arm  and  led  me 
down  the  sidewalk  to  his 
silver  Taurus.  He  even 
opened  the  passenger’s  door 
for  me,  like  boys  do  in  those 
old  movies.  Very  classy.  I 
couldn’t  help  wondering, 
again,  why  on  earth  he  was 
interested  in  me.  He  put  the 
key  in  the  ignition  and  turned 


to  smile  at  me.  His  smile  was 
definitely  his  best  feature.  So 
I  smiled  back,  feeling  the 
little  butterflies  flutter  around 
in  the  pit  of  my  stomach. 

“I  hope  you’re  hungry,” 
he  said. 

“Starved,”  I  lied,  knowing 
very  well  that  I  was  way  too 
nervous  to  eat. 

By  the  time  we  left 
Giovanni’s,  a  tiny  Italian 


restaurant  in  Oak  Hill,  I’d 
become  a  little  more 
comfortable.  My  nerves  were 
dying  down,  and  I’d  even 
managed  to  eat  a  small  bowl 
of  meatless  spaghetti.  We 
were  laughing  and  talking, 
and  I  was  enjoying  myself  so 
much  that  I  didn’t  want  the 
date  to  be  over  when  Toby 
paid  the  bill.  Lucky  for  me, 
he  felt  the  same  way. 

“You  know,”  he  said  as 


the  bells  on  the  door  jingled 
behind  us.  “It’s  only  nine- 
thirty.  I  don’t  have  to  take 
you  home  yet. . .  unless  you 
want  to  go  home,  which  is 
fine,  of  course.” 

“No,”  I  said.  “I’m  not  in  a 
hurry  to  go  home.  But  what 
do  you  want  to  do?” 

“Well,  we  can  walk,” 
Toby  suggested.  He  gestured 
down  the  sidewalk  that  ran 
alongside  the  busy  street. 


“It’s  not  very  exciting,  but  we 
can  window-shop  or  talk  or 

I  smiled  at  him.  “Walking 
sounds  fun.” 

“Wonderful.” 

He  looped  his  arm  in 
mine,  and  we  began  to  stroll 
down  the  well-lit  sidewalk. 
We’d  passed  a  couple  small 
shops  before  either  of  us 
spoke.  Thank  God  he  opened 
his  mouth  first  because,  even 


though  I  wasn’t  that  nervous 
anymore,  I  had  no  clue  what  I 
could  say  that  wouldn’t  make 
me  sound  like  a  complete 
goofball. 

“Well,  since  you  know  all 
about  my  college  situation,  I 
want  to  know  about  yours. 
Have  you  applied  anywhere 
yet?”  he  asked. 

“Yeah.  I’ve  applied  to  a 
couple,  but  I  haven’t  picked 
one  yet.  I  guess  I’m  kind  of 


procrastinating.” 

“Do  you  know  what  you’ll 
major  in?” 

“Probably  journalism,”  I 
said.  “I  don’t  know,  though. 
I’ve  always  wanted  to  be  a 
reporter  for  the  New  York 
Times.  So  I  applied  to  a 
couple  of  schools  in 
Manhattan.” 

“The  Big  Apple,”  he  said, 
nodding.  “Ambitious.” 

“Yeah,  well,  watch  me 


end  up  like  that  girl  in  The 
Devil  Wears  Prada  I  said. 
“A  complete  loser  working  at 
some  stupid  fashion  magazine 
when  all  I  really  want  to  do  is 
write  about  world  events  or 
interview  revolutionary 
congressmen...  like  you’ll 
be.” 

He  beamed  at  me.  “Oh, 
you  wouldn’t  be  a  complete 
loser.” 

“Whatever,”  I  laughed. 


“Can  you  imagine  me  writing 
about  fashion?  An  industry 
where  size  fours  are 
considered  fat?  No  way.  I’d 
wind  up  committing  suicide.” 

“Something  tells  me  you’d 
be  good  at  anything  you 
tried,”  he  said. 

“Something  tells  me 
you’re  kissing  my  ass  a  little 
bit  there,  Toby.” 

He  shrugged.  “Maybe,  but 
not  much.  You’re  pretty 


great,  Bianca.  You  tell  it  like 
it  is,  you  don’t  seem  like 
you’re  afraid  to  be  yourself, 
and  you’re  a  Democrat.  That 
makes  you  awesome  in  my 
book.” 

Okay,  so  I  blushed.  Can 
you  blame  me? 

“Thank  you,  Toby.” 

“There’s  nothing  to  thank 
me  for.” 

Wow.  Was  he  perfect  or 
what?  Cute,  polite,  funny. . . 


and  he  liked  me  for  some 
unknown  reason.  It  was  like 
we  were  made  for  each  other. 
Like  he  had  the  puzzle  piece 
that  fit  with  mine.  Could  I  get 
any  luckier? 

A  cold  March  breeze  was 
blowing,  and  I  began 
regretting  that  I’d  let  Casey 
and  Jessica  dress  me.  They’d 
never  been  seasonably 
sensible  when  it  came  to 
clothing.  My  bare  legs  were 


freezing  (they  hadn’t  let  me 
wear  panty  hose),  and  the  thin 
material  of  my  blouse 
definitely  didn’t  shield  me 
from  the  wind.  I  shivered  and 
wrapped  my  arms  around 
myself  in  an  effort  to  warm 
up. 

“Oh,  here,”  Toby  said.  He 
pulled  off  his  blazer,  just  like 
boys  are  supposed  to  do,  and 
held  it  out  for  me.  “You 
should  have  told  me  you  were 


cold.” 

“I’m  fine.” 

“Don’t  be  silly.”  He 
helped  me  slide  into  the 
sleeves.  “Honestly,  I’d  rather 
not  be  dating  a  Popsicle.” 

Dating?  I  mean,  this  was  a 
date,  but  were  we  dating 
now?  I’d  never  dated  anyone, 
so  I  wasn’t  really  sure.  Either 
way,  hearing  him  say  that 
made  me  very  happy. . .  and 
strangely  nervous  at  the  same 


time. 

Toby  turned  me  around 
and  adjusted  the  blazer 
around  my  neck  and 
shoulders. 

“Thanks,”  I  murmured. 

We  were  standing  in  front 
of  an  old  antiques  store,  its 
windows  illuminated  by  the 
light  of  fancy,  old-fashioned 
lamps,  like  the  ones  my 
grandpa  had  in  his  living 
room.  The  glow  spilled  onto 


Toby’s  angular  face,  glinting 
off  the  rims  of  his  glasses  and 
highlighting  his  almond- 
shaped  eyes . . .  which  were 
staring  down  at  me. 

His  fingers  still  lingered 
on  the  collar  of  the  blazer. 
Then  his  hand  slid  up  from 
my  shoulder  to  my  jaw.  His 
thumb  grazed  my  cheek, 
stroking  it  over  and  over 
again.  He  leaned  toward  me 
slowly,  giving  me  plenty  of 


time  to  stop  him  if  I  wanted 
to.  Yeah,  right!  As  if  I  would 
dream  of  it. 

And  he  kissed  me.  Not  a 
make-out  kiss,  but  not  just  a 
peck  either.  It  was  a  real  kiss. 
Gentle  and  sweet  and  long. 
The  kind  of  kiss  I’d  wanted  to 
share  with  Toby  Tucker  since 
I  was  fifteen  years  old,  and  it 
felt  exactly  like  I’d  always 
imagined  it  would.  His  lips 
were  soft  and  warm,  and  the 


way  they  moved  against  mine 
made  the  butterflies  in  my 
belly  go  berserk. 

Okay.  I  know,  I  know.  I 
think  PDA  is  gross  and 
immature,  but  come  on.  I  was 
a  little  too  distracted  to  care 
who  might  be  watching.  So, 
yeah,  I  put  my  usual  values 
aside  for  a  second  and 
wrapped  my  arms  around  his 
neck.  I  mean,  I  could  always 
go  back  to  my  crusade  against 


public  make-outs  in  the 
morning. 


I  slipped  into  the  house 
around  eleven  o’clock  that 
night  and  found  Dad  waiting 
for  me  on  the  sofa.  He  smiled 
at  me  and  muted  the  TV. 
“Hey,  Bumblebee.” 

“Hi,  Dad.”  I  shut  and 
locked  the  front  door.  “How 
was  your  meeting?” 

“Strange,”  Dad  admitted. 


“It’s  weird  being  back 
again. . .  but  I’ll  get  used  to  it. 
What  about  you?  How  was 
your  date?” 

“Amazing,”  I  sighed.  God, 
I  couldn’t  stop  smiling.  Dad 
was  probably  going  to  think 
I’d  had  a  lobotomy  or 
something. 

“That’s  good,”  Dad  said. 
“Tell  me  again,  who  did  you 
go  out  with?  Sorry.  I  can’t 
remember  his  name.” 


“Toby  Tucker.” 

“Tucker?”  Dad  repeated. 
“You  mean  Chaz  Tucker’s 
son?  Oh,  that’s  great, 
Bumblebee.  Chaz  is  a  good 
guy.  He’s  the  technology 
director  for  a  company 
downtown,  so  he  comes  into 
the  store  all  the  time. 
Wonderful  family.  I’m  glad 
to  hear  his  son’s  a  nice  kid, 
too.” 

“He  is,”  I  said. 


The  sound  of  shuffling 
came  from  upstairs,  and  we 
both  glanced  up  at  the  ceiling. 
“Oh.”  Dad  shook  his  head 
and  looked  back  at  me.  “I 
almost  forgot  about  them. 
They’ve  been  suspiciously 
quiet  all  night.” 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “I  should 
get  up  there  before  Casey  has 
an  aneurysm.  See  you  in  the 
morning,  Dad.” 

“Okay,”  Dad  said.  He 


reached  for  the  remote  and 
turned  up  the  volume  on  the 
television.  “Good  night, 
Bumblebee.” 

I’d  danced  halfway  up  the 
stairs  before  Dad  called  out  to 
me  again.  “Hey, 

Bumblebee?” 

I  paused  and  leaned 
against  the  banister,  looking 
down  at  the  living  room. 
“Yeah?” 

“Whatever  happened  to 


Wesley?” 

I  froze,  feeling  myself 
choke  a  little.  “W-What?” 

“Your  friend.  The  one 
who,  um. . .  was  with  you  that 
night.”  He  looked  up  at  me 
from  the  couch,  readjusting 
his  glasses.  “You  don’t  talk 
about  him  much.” 

“We  don’t  hang  out 
anymore,”  I  told  him,  using 
that  voice  that  made  it  clear 
he  shouldn’t  ask  questions. 


All  teenage  girls  know  that 
voice  and  use  it  on  their 
fathers  frequently.  Usually, 
the  unspoken  order  is 
followed.  My  father  loved 
me,  but  he  knew  better  than 
to  delve  into  the  drama  of  my 
high  school  experience. 

Smart  Dad. 

“Oh...  I  was  just 
wondering.” 

“Bianca!”  My  bedroom 
door  flew  open,  and  Jessica, 


dressed  in  neon  orange 
pajamas,  leapt  out  of  my 
room.  She  sprinted  halfway 
down  the  stairs  and  grabbed 
me  by  the  arm.  “Stop  making 
us  wait!  Come  tell  us 
everything.” 

The  way  Jessica  was 
beaming  almost  pushed  Dad’s 
mention  of  Wesley  from  my 
mind. 

Almost. 

“Goodnight,  Mr.  Piper!” 


Jessica  yelled  as  she  dragged 
me  to  my  bedroom. 

After  a  few  steps,  my  feet 
picked  up  again  and  I 
reminded  myself  that  I’d  just 
had  the  best  date  ever  with 
the  guy  of  my  dreams.  I  felt 
myself  succumbing  to  the 
giddy  joy  my  best  friends 
expressed  as  soon  as  I  walked 
into  the  room.  Squealing, 
jumping,  cheering. . . 

I  had  the  right  to  be  happy 


about  this.  Even  we  cynics 
deserved  a  night  off  once  in  a 
while,  right? 


22 


My  good  mood  lasted  all  the 
way  through  to  Monday 
afternoon.  I  mean,  what  was 
there  to  be  irritated  about? 
Nothing.  Things  were  back  to 
normal  at  home.  My  friends 
hadn’t  dragged  me  to  the  Nest 
in  weeks.  Oh  yeah,  and  I’d 


just  gone  on  a  date  with  the 
perfect  boy.  Who  could 
complain? 

“I  don’t  think  I’ve  ever 
seen  you  this  happy,”  Casey 
observed  as  we  pulled  out  of 
the  student  parking  lot.  Her 
voice  was  full  of  pep,  an 
unfortunate  side  effect  of 
cheerleading  practice,  and  she 
bounced  up  and  down  in  her 
seat.  “It’s  so  refreshing!” 

“God,  Casey,  you  make 


me  sound  suicidal  or 
something.” 

“It’s  not  that,”  she  said. 
“It’s  just  that  you  haven’t 
been  as  bitter  as  usual  lately. 
It’s  a  nice  change.” 

“I’m  not  bitter.” 

“You  are  so.”  She  reached 
over  and  patted  my  knee. 

“But  that’s  okay,  B.  It’s  just 
part  of  your  personality.  We 
accept  it.  But  you  aren ’t 
bitter  now,  and  that’s  freaking 


awesome.  Don’t  take  it  as  an 
insult.” 

“Whatever.”  But  I  broke 
into  a  smile. 

“See  there!”  Casey  cried. 
“You’re  grinning.  You  can’t 
stop,  can  you?  Like  I  said, 
you’re  happier  than  I’ve  ever 
seen  you.” 

“Okay,  maybe  you’re  kind 
of  right,”  I  admitted.  It  was 
sort  of  true.  I  had  Casey  and 
Jessica  back.  Things  were 


normal  again  with  Dad.  Why 
complain? 

“I  always  am.”  She  leaned 
forward  and  changed  the 
radio  to  some  shitty  Top  40 
station.  “So,  what’s  up  with 
you  and  Toby?  Anything 
gossip-worthy?” 

“Not  really.  He’s  coming 
over  this  afternoon.” 

“Ooh!”  She  sat  back  in  her 
seat  and  winked  at  me. 
“Sounds  gossip-worthy  to 


me.  You’ve  picked  up  some 
extra-large  condoms,  right?” 

“Shut  up,”  I  said.  “It’s  not 
that  kind  of  thing,  and  you 
know  it.  He’s  just  coming 
over  to  work  on  our  editorials 
for  AP  government.  It’s — ” 

I  was  cut  off  when  my  cell 
phone,  which  was  lying  in  the 
cup  holder,  started  vibrating 
and  playing  loud  music.  My 
fingers  instantly  clinched 
around  the  steering  wheel.  I 


knew  who  I’d  set  that 
ringtone  for,  and  those  few 
chords  were  all  it  took  to 
derail  my  entire  afternoon. 

“Britney  Spears?  You 
have  ‘Womanizer’  as  a 
ringtone,  seriously?  OMG,  B, 
that  song  is  so,  like,  two 
thousand  eight,”  Casey 
laughed. 

I  didn’t  say  anything. 

“Aren’t  you  gonna  answer 


it?” 


“No.” 

“Why  not?” 

“Because  I  don’t  wanna 
talk  to  him.” 

“Who?” 

I  didn’t  respond,  so  Casey 
picked  up  my  cell  phone  and 
checked  the  ID.  I  heard  her 
let  out  a  knowing  sigh.  A  few 
seconds  later,  the  music 
stopped  playing,  but  I 
couldn’t  force  my  body  to 
relax  again.  I  felt  stiff  and 


anxious,  and  it  didn’t  help 
that  Casey  had  her  eyes  glued 
on  me. 

“You  haven’t  talked  to 
him?” 

“No,”  I  muttered. 

“Since  the  day  I  picked 
you  up  from  his  house?” 

“Mm-mm.” 

“Oh,  B,”  she  sighed. 

The  car  became  quiet — 
well,  except  for  the  annoying 
sound  of  an  untalented  pop 


singer  on  the  radio,  but  she 
was  too  busy  whining  about 
her  cheating  boyfriend  to  care 
about  my  issues. 

“What  do  you  think  he 
wants?”  Casey  asked  when 
the  song  ended.  She  sounded 
a  little  bitter. 

“Knowing  Wesley. . . 
probably  a  booty  call,”  I 
grumbled.  “It’s  never 
anything  more  than  that.” 

“Well,  then,  it’s  a  good 


thing  you  didn’t  answer.”  She 
tossed  my  phone  back  into 
the  cup  holder  and  folded  her 
arms  over  her  chest.  “Because 
he  doesn’t  deserve  you,  B. 
And  you’re  with  Toby  now, 
and  he’s  perfect  for  you  and 
treats  you  the  way  you  should 
be  treated. . .  unlike  the 
douche  bag.” 

Part  of  me  wanted  to  stop 
her.  To  defend  Wesley.  He 
hadn’t  really  treated  me 


badly.  I  mean,  yeah,  he’d 
called  me  Duffy  to  no  end, 
which  was  annoying  and 
hurtful,  but  overall,  Wesley 
had  been  good  to  me. 

I  didn’t  tell  Casey  this, 
though.  I  didn’t  say  anything 
at  all.  She  didn’t  know  about 
that  last  night  with  Wesley, 
how  he  had  been  my  friend 
for  about  twelve  solid  hours. 
She  didn’t  know  about  Dad’s 
relapse,  or  the  way  Wesley 


had  stood  up  for  me.  Those 
were  things  I  could  never  tell 
her. 

She  was  getting  pissed  at 
him  only  because  she  was 
scared.  Scared  I’d  run  back  to 
him  and  forget  about  her  and 
Jessica  again.  Defending 
Wesley  wouldn’t  have  helped 
put  that  worry  to  rest. 

Toby  had  gone  from  geek 
to  hero  in  Casey’s  mind  in  a 
matter  of  days.  Simply 


because  he  hadn’t  taken  me 
from  her.  I  wasn’t  spending 
every  afternoon  with  him  the 
way  I  had  with  Wesley.  I 
didn’t  really  want  to. 
Sometimes  that  scared  me, 
but  I  figured  that  that  was 
normal.  This  was  a  healthy, 
nonescapist  relationship, 
unlike  what  I’d  had  with 
Wesley.  And  at  the  moment,  I 
was  really  happy  to  be 
spending  some  time  with  my 


friends. 

I  turned  into  Casey’s 
driveway  and  hit  the 
automatic  unlock  button  on 
my  door.  “Don’t  worry  about 
me.  You’re  right.  Toby  is 
awesome,  and  he’s  made  it  so 
much  easier  to  move  on.  I 
already  have.  Things  are 
going  well  for  me,  so  don’t 
worry.” 

“Okay,”  she  said.  “Good. 
Well,  I’ll  see  you  tomorrow, 


B.” 


“Bye.” 

She  climbed  out  of  the 
car,  and  I  drove  away, 
wondering  whether  I’d  just 
lied  to  her.  Honestly,  I  wasn’t 
sure. 

On  the  way  home,  Wesley 
called  again. 

I  ignored  him. 

Because  things  were  going 
well  for  me. 

Because  I  was  moving  on. 


Because  talking  on  a  cell 
phone  and  driving  at  the  same 
time  just  isn’t  safe. 

I  pushed  Wesley  out  of 
my  mind  when  I  saw  Toby’s 
car  already  parked  in  my 
driveway.  Dad  wasn’t  home 
from  work  yet,  so  he  sat  on 
the  front  porch  steps  with  a 
book.  The  sun  glinted  off  the 
rims  of  his  glasses,  making 
them  look  extra  sparkly.  Like 
he  was  a  trophy. 


I  got  out  of  the  car  and 
hurried  up  the  sidewalk 
toward  him.  “Hey,”  I  said. 
“Sorry.  I  had  to  take  Casey 
home.” 

He  looked  up  at  me  with  a 
smile. 

Not  a  crooked  grin. . . 

I  had  to  shake  myself.  I 
wasn’t  going  to  think  about 
Wesley.  I  wasn’t  going  to  let 
myself  miss  him.  Not  when  I 
had  Toby.  Sweet,  normal, 


sparkly- smiling  Toby. 

“It’s  fine,”  he  said.  “I’m 
enjoying  the  weather.  It’s  so 
unpredictable  in  the  spring.” 
He  stuck  his  bookmark  in  the 
pages  of  his  novel.  “It’s  nice 
to  have  a  little  bit  of 
sunlight.” 

“Bronte?”  I  asked,  seeing 
the  cover  of  his  book. 
“Wuthering Heights]  Isn’t 
that  a  little  girly,  Toby?” 

“Have  you  read  it?” 


“Well,  no,”  I  admitted. 
“I’ve  read  Jane  Eyre,  which 
was  definitely  full  of  early 
feminism.  I’m  not  saying 
that’s  a  problem.  Personally, 
I’m  a  total  feminist,  but  it’s  a 
little  sketchy  for  a  teenage 
boy.” 

Toby  shook  his  head. 

“ Jane  Eyre  is  Charlotte 
Bronte.  Wuthering  Heights  is 
Emily.  The  sisters  are  very, 
very  different.  Yes, 


Wuthering  Heights  is  usually 
considered  a  love  story,  but  I 
disagree  with  that.  It’s  almost 
a  ghost  story,  and  there’s 
more  hate  than  romance. 
Every  character  is  atrocious 
and  spoiled  and  selfish. ...  It’s 
kind  of  like  watching  an 
episode  of  Gossip  Girl  in  the 
eighteen  hundreds.  Except,  of 
course,  much  less  ridiculous.” 

“Interesting,”  I  muttered, 
chagrined  that  I  secretly 


watched  Gossip  Girl  on  a 
regular  basis. 

“It  isn’t  a  favorite  of  most 
boys  my  age,  I  guess,”  he 
said.  “But  it’s  a  page-turner. 
You  should  read  it.” 

“I  might.” 

“You  should.” 

I  smiled  and  shook  my 
head.  “Are  you  ready  to  go  in 
or  what?” 

“Absolutely.”  He  snapped 
the  book  shut  and  got  to  his 


feet.  “Lead  the  way.” 

I  unlocked  the  door  and  let 
him  walk  inside  ahead  of  me, 
where  he  immediately  took 
his  shoes  off.  Not  that  we  live 
like  pigs  or  anything,  but  no 
one  ever  does  that  in  our 
house.  I  couldn’t  help  being 
impressed. 

“Where  will  we  be 
working?”  he  asked. 

I  realized  suddenly  that  I 
was  watching  him  and  looked 


away.  “Oh,”  I  said  casually. 
“Um. . .  my  room?  Is  that 
okay?”  God,  I  hope  he 
doesn  ’t  think  I’m  a  stalker 
freak  for  staring  at  him  like 
that. 

“If  it  doesn’t  bother  you,” 
Toby  said. 

“No,  it’s  cool.  Come  on.” 

He  followed  me  up  the 
stairs.  When  we  reached  my 
bedroom,  I  pushed  the  door 
open  a  crack,  checking 


quickly  for  embarrassing 
items  (bras,  panties,  et  cetera) 
that  might  be  lying  on  the 
floor.  Sure  the  coast  was  clear 
— and  praying  I  hadn’t  been 
too  obvious — I  swung  the 
door  the  rest  of  the  way  open 
and  gestured  for  Toby  to  walk 
inside. 

“Sorry  it’s  a  little  messy,” 

I  said,  looking  down  at  the 
pile  of  unfolded,  clean  clothes 
that  always  stayed  on  the 


floor  at  the  foot  of  my  bed 
and  trying  not  to  think  about 
the  last  time  I’d  had  a  boy  in 
my  room  and  how  he’d 
laughed  at  my  neurotic 
clothes  folding.  What  would 
Toby  think  of  it? 

“It’s  fine.”  Toby  moved  a 
stack  of  overdue  library 
books  out  of  my  chair  and 
placed  them  on  the  desk. 
Then  he  sat  down.  “We’re 
seventeen.  Our  rooms  are 


supposed  to  be  messy.  It 
wouldn’t  be  natural  if  they 
weren’t.” 

“I  guess  not.”  I  climbed 
onto  my  bed  and  sat  with  my 
legs  crisscrossed.  “I  just 
didn’t  want  it  to  bug  you.” 

“Nothing  about  you  could 
bug  me,  Bianca.” 

It  took  everything  I  had  to 
ignore  how  cheesy  that 
sounded.  I  smiled  anyway 
and  looked  down  at  my 


purple  comforter.  I’d  never 
received  so  many 
compliments  from  one 
person,  and  I  wasn’t  very 
good  at  accepting  them. 
Mostly  because  I  was  always 
too  busy  mocking  how  mushy 
they  were.  But  I  was  working 
on  that. 

And  the  truth  was,  I  was 
kind  of  blushing. 

I  didn’t  even  notice  Toby 
had  moved  until  he  was 


sitting  beside  me.  “Sorry,”  he 
said.  “Did  I  embarrass  you?” 

“No. . .  well,  yeah,  but  in  a 
good  way.” 

“As  long  as  it’s  in  a  good 
way.” 

He  leaned  forward  and 
kissed  me  on  the  cheek,  but  I 
didn’t  let  him  stop  there.  I 
turned  my  head  and  pressed 
my  lips  against  his,  just  as  he 
started  to  pull  back.  It  didn’t 
go  quite  as  smoothly  as  I’d 


hoped.  I  mean,  his  glasses 
kind  of  knocked  me  in  the 
face  for  a  second,  but  I 
pretended  I  hadn’t  noticed. 

His  lips  were  so  soft  that  I 
wondered  if  he  used 
ChapStick.  Seriously,  nobody 
has  lips  that  perfect  naturally, 
do  they?  He  must  have  been 
disgusted  by  mine,  which 
probably  felt  rough  and  scaly 
to  him. 

But  if  he  was,  he  didn’t 


show  it.  His  hand  moved  up 
my  arm  and  rested  on  my 
shoulder,  pulling  me  a  little 
closer.  We  sat  on  my  bed  and 
kissed  for  a  few  minutes,  but 
the  sound  of  my  cell  phone 
broke  the  moment.  Damn  it! 

And  of  course,  it  was  that 
same  Britney  Spears  ringtone 
— the  one  I  wanted  least  to 
hear  at  that  exact  moment — 
that  seemed  to  scream  at  me. 
Toby  pulled  away  and  looked 


down  at  the  floor  where  I’d 
dropped  my  purse.  When  I 
didn’t  move,  he  turned  back 
to  me  with  raised  eyebrows. 

“Ignoring  someone?”  he 
asked. 

“Well,...  um,  yeah.” 

“Are  you  sure  you  don’t 
need  to  answer  it?” 

“Positive.” 

Before  he  could  ask  any 
more  questions,  I  kissed  him 
again.  Hard  this  time.  And 


even  though  he  hesitated  for 
an  instant,  he  returned  it.  I 
fumbled  to  take  off  his 
glasses  and  placed  them  on 
the  nightstand  beside  my  bed 
before  our  arms  twisted 
around  each  other,  the  kiss 
deepening. 

I  pulled  him  down  onto 
the  pillows  with  me.  There 
wasn’t  quite  enough  room  for 
both  of  us  on  my  twin  bed,  so 
he  had  to  lie  partially  on  top 


of  me.  One  of  his  hands  was 
in  my  hair,  and  the  other 
rested  near  my  elbow. 

He  wasn’t  trying  to  grab 
my  boob,  he  hadn’t  slid  his 
hand  up  my  shirt,  and  he 
didn’t  attempt  to  unzip  my 
jeans. 

Actually,  Toby  didn’t  try 
anything  risky.  I  had  the 
feeling  I  was  going  to  have  to 
make  all  of  the  big  moves, 
like  loosening  the  buttons  on 


his  shirt,  which  I  did. 

For  an  instant,  I  wondered 
if  he  was  hesitating  because 
of  me.  Because  I  was  the 
Duff.  Because  he  didn’t  really 
find  me  attractive.  Despite  all 
those  compliments  he  paid 
me,  it  didn’t  feel  like  he 
wanted  me.  Not  the  way 
Wesley  had. 

No.  I  knew  that  wasn’t 
right.  It  wasn’t  that  Toby 
didn’t  want  the  big  things — 


he  was  a  teenage  boy,  after  all 
— but  he  was  a  gentleman.  A 
patient,  respectful  boy  who 
didn’t  want  to  cross  any  lines. 
And  we’d  only  been  dating 
for  a  couple  of  days. 

Did  that  make  me  a  slut? 
The  fact  that  we’d  only  been 
dating  for,  like,  four  days  and 
I  was  already  rolling  around 
with  him  in  my  teeny-tiny 
bed?  Had  my  thing  with 
Wesley  totally  twisted  my 


perception  of  sex? 

Or  did  every  girl  do  it? 

Vikki  slept  with  most  of 
her  boyfriends  on  the  first 
date. 

The  whole  school  thought 
Vikki  was  a  whore,  though. 

Casey  had  slept  with  Zack 
only  a  week  after  they’d 
started  going  out. 

Casey  had  been  fifteen  at 
the  time,  and  Zack  was  her 
first  real  boyfriend.  She  was 


naive  and  stupid,  and  she 
didn’t  hesitate  to  admit  that  it 
was  a  major  mistake. 

But  I  knew  I  wouldn’t  feel 
that  way  about  Toby.  I  mean, 
I  was  the  one  pushing  this 
forward.  I  wanted  to  go 
farther  with  him.  Because  I 
liked  him.  Because  he  was 
cute  and  sweet.  Because  he 
wasn’t  ashamed  to  date  me.  I 
couldn’t  think  of  one  good 
reason  not  to  sleep  with  him. 


God,  I  just  wanted  to  stop 
thinking.  I  kissed  him  harder, 
pulled  him  closer,  trying  to 
re-create  that  mind-numbing 
feeling  I’d  had  before. . .  with 
Wesley.  But  it  wasn’t 
working.  I  couldn’t  stop 
thinking. 

I  undid  the  rest  of  the 
buttons  on  Toby’s  shirt  and 
helped  him  throw  it  onto  the 
floor.  He  was  kind  of 
scrawny  with  hardly  any 


muscle — Casey  would  have 
called  him  “skinny  chic”  or 
something.  Tentatively,  his 
hands  began  to  lift  the  hem  of 
my  T-shirt.  He  moved  slowly 
in  case  I  wanted  to  stop  him. 
Just  like  how  he  kissed  me, 
always  worried  he  might  have 
crossed  the  line.  I  hooked  my 
leg  around  his  waist  and 
ground  my  body  against  his. 
No  lines.  Maybe  there  were 
no  lines.  Maybe  I’d  never  had 


any  to  begin  with. 

God  knows  how  long  we 
spent  making  out  on  my  bed, 
pieces  of  clothing  being 
removed  at  a  snail’s  pace.  I 
was  already  breathless  by  the 
time  he  had  the  nerve  to  pull 
my  T-shirt  over  my  head  and 
toss  it  to  the  carpet.  While 
part  of  me  appreciated  his 
patience,  I  couldn’t  help 
thinking,  Took  you  long 
enough. 


I  could  feel  his  right  hand 
inching — like  a  turtle — 
toward  the  clasp  of  my  bra. 

At  this  rate,  it  would  have 
been  midnight  before  he  got  it 
off,  and  for  some  reason,  I 
felt  urgent  and  anxious.  I 
wanted  him  to  get  it  off.  I 
wanted  to  feel  attractive  and 
desired.  I  wanted  to  stop 
thinking.  Sol  pushed  him 
away  and  sat  up,  my  legs  still 
wrapped  around  him.  We 


both  breathed  heavily,  gazing 
at  each  other. 

“Are  you  sure  about  this?” 
Toby  whispered. 

“Very.” 

I  reached  around  to  undo 
the  clasp,  but  right  when  my 
fingers  grazed  the  hook,  there 
was  a  knock  on  my  bedroom 
door. 

“Bianca?” 

Toby  and  I  jumped.  Both 
our  necks  snapped  around 


just  as  the  door  swung  open. 

Wesley  Rush  stared  back 
at  us,  frozen  in  the  doorway. 


23 


“Oh  God,”  I  muttered  as 
Toby  and  I  made  a  frantic 
effort  to  untangle  ourselves. 
He  scrambled  off  my  bed  and 
grabbed  his  shirt  off  the  floor, 
his  face  glowing  scarlet.  I 
reached  down  and  picked  up 
my  T-shirt.  “Wesley,  how  did 


you  get  in  here?”  I  demanded. 

“The  door  was  unlocked,” 
he  said.  “You  didn’t  answer 
when  I  knocked. . . .  Now  I  can 
see  why.”  His  dark  gray  eyes 
were  big  with  what  I  could 
only  guess  was  shock, 
dissolving  quickly  into 
disgust,  and  they  stared 
directly  at  Toby. 

Why  was  he  shocked? 

Because  he  didn’t  think 
anyone  else  would  fool 


around  with  the  Duff? 

“But  what  are  you  doing 
here?”  I  asked,  feeling  a 
sudden  surge  of  anger  rush 
through  my  veins.  I  yanked 
my  T-shirt  over  my  head  and 
stood  up. 

“You  weren’t  answering 
your  phone,”  Wesley 
muttered.  “I  was  worried,  but 
it  looks  like  you’re  just  fine.” 
He  glared  at  Toby  for  a 
moment  before  looking  back 


at  me.  “My  mistake.” 

Now  he  was  the  one  who 
looked  angry. 

Angry  and  hurt. 

I  didn’t  get  it. 

I  looked  over  at  Toby.  His 
shirt  was  on  and  buttoned, 
and  he  was  staring 
awkwardly  at  his  feet.  “Hey,” 
I  said.  He  looked  up  at  me. 
“I’ll  be  right  back,  okay?” 

He  nodded. 

I  pushed  Wesley  into  the 


hallway  with  one  hand  and 
shut  my  bedroom  door  behind 
me  with  the  other.  “God, 
Wesley,”  I  hissed,  irritated  as 
I  ushered  him  down  the  stairs. 
“I  always  knew  you  were  a 
perv,  but  watching  me? 

That’s  a  whole  new  level  of 
creepy.” 

I  assumed  he’d  say 
something  to  that.  Something 
arrogant  and  cocky.  Or 
maybe  just  tease  me,  the  way 


he  always  did.  But  he  just 
stared  at  me,  a  serious 
expression  on  his  face.  Not  at 
all  what  I’d  expected  from 
Wesley. 

Silence. 

“So,”  he  said  at  last.  “You 
and  Tucker  are  together 
now?” 

“Yes,”  I  answered 
uneasily.  “We  are.” 

“When  did  that  happen?” 

“Last  week. . .  not  that  it’s 


any  of  your  business.” 
Another  jab.  Another  attempt 
to  make  this  conversation 
normal. 

But  he  didn’t  take  the  bait. 
“Right.  Sorry.”  He  sounded 
so  awkward.  So  different 
from  the  smooth,  confident 
Wesley  I  was  used  to. 

Another  uncomfortable 
silence. 

“Why  are  you  here, 
Wesley?” 


“I  told  you,”  he  said.  “I 
got  worried.  You’ve  been 
avoiding  me  for  the  past  week 
at  school,  and  when  I  called 
you  today,  you  didn’t  answer. 
I  thought  something  might 
have  happened  with  your  dad. 
Sol  came  to  make  sure  you 
were  okay.” 

I  bit  my  lower  lip,  a  wave 
of  guilt  washing  over  me. 
“That’s  sweet,”  I  murmured. 
“But  I’m  fine.  Dad 


apologized  for  the  other 
night,  and  he’s  going  to  AA 
meetings  now,  so. . 

“So  you  weren’t  going  to 
tell  me?” 

“Why  would  I?” 

“Because  I  care!”  Wesley 
yelled.  His  words  crashed 
into  me,  stunning  me  for  a 
second.  “I’ve  been  worried 
about  you  since  you  left  my 
house  a  week  ago!  You  didn’t 
even  say  why  you  left, 


Bianca.  What  was  I  supposed 
to  do?  Just  assume  you  would 
be  all  right?” 

“God,”  I  whispered.  “I’m 
sorry.  I  didn’t — ” 

“I’m  worrying  about  you, 
and  you’re  fucking  that 
pretentious  little — !” 

“Hey!”  I  shouted.  “Don’t 
bring  Toby  into  this.” 

“Why  have  you  been 
avoiding  me?”  he  asked. 

“I  haven’t  been  avoiding 


you.” 

“Don’t  lie,”  Wesley  said. 
“You’ve  been  doing 
everything  you  can  to  stay 
away  from  me.  You  won’t 
even  look  at  me  in  class,  and 
you  practically  sprint  down 
the  hallway  if  you  see  me 
coming.  Even  when  you 
hated  me,  you  didn’t  act  like 
that.  You  might  threaten  to 
stab  me,  but  you  never — ” 

“I  still  hate  you,”  I  snarled 


up  at  him.  “You’re 
infuriating!  You  act  like  I 
owe  you  something.  I’m  sorry 
I  made  you  worry,  Wesley, 
but  I  just  can’t  be  around  you 
anymore.  You  helped  me 
escape  from  my  problems  for 
a  while,  and  I  appreciate  that, 
but  I  have  to  face  reality.  I 
can’t  keep  running  away.” 

“But  that  is  exactly  what 
you’re  doing  right  now,” 
Wesley  hissed.  “You’re 


running  away.” 

“Excuse  me?” 

“Don’t  pretend,  Bianca,” 
he  said.  “You’re  smarter  than 
that,  and  so  am  1. 1  finally 
figured  out  what  you  meant 
when  you  left.  Y ou  said  you 
were  like  Hester.  I  get  it  now. 
The  first  time  you  came  to 
my  house,  when  we  wrote 
that  paper,  you  said  Hester 
was  trying  to  escape.  But 
everything  caught  up  with 


Hester  in  the  end,  didn’t  it? 
Well,  something  finally 
caught  up  with  you,  but 
you’re  just  running  away 
again.  Only,  he” — Wesley 
pointed  to  my  bedroom  door 
— “is  your  escape  this  time.” 
He  took  a  step  toward  me, 
forcing  me  to  crane  my  neck 
even  more  to  see  his  face. 
“Admit  it,  Duffy.” 

“Admit  what?” 

“That  you’re  running 


away  from  me he  said. 
“You  realized  you’re  in  love 
with  me  and  you  bailed 
because  it  scared  the  shit  out 
of  you.” 

I  scoffed  as  if  it  were 
ridiculous — wishing  it  were 
ridiculous — and  rolled  my 
eyes,  stepping  back  to  show 
he  couldn’t  intimidate  me, 
that  he  wasn’t  right.  “Oh  my 
God.  Get  over  yourself. 
You’re  so  fucking  dramatic, 


Wesley.  This  isn’t  a  damn 
soap  opera.” 

“You  know  it’s  true.” 

“Even  if  it  is,”  I  cried, 
“what  does  it  matter?  You 
could  sleep  with  anybody, 
Wesley.  So  what  if  I  walk 
away?  So  what  if  I  have 
feelings  for  you?  I  was  just  a 
screw  to  you!  You  would 
never  actually  commit  to  me. 
You  could  never  commit  to 
anyone,  but  especially  not  to 


Duffy.  You  don’t  even  find 
me  attractive.” 

“Bullshit,”  he  growled,  his 
eyes  on  my  face  as  he  moved 
closer  to  me  again. 

He  was  so  close.  My  back 
was  pressed  to  the  wall,  and 
Wesley  stood  only  inches 
away.  It  had  only  been  a 
week,  but  it  felt  like  ages 
since  we’d  been  in  this  kind 
of  proximity.  A  shiver  ran  up 
my  spine  as  I  remembered  the 


way  his  hands  felt  on  me.  The 
way  he’d  always  made  me 
feel  wanted,  even  if  he  had 
called  me  the  Duff.  Did  he? 
Did  he  find  me  attractive 
despite  the  nickname?  How? 
Why? 

“Then  why  would  you  call 
me  that?”  I  whispered.  “Do 
you  know  how  much  it  hurts? 
Every  time  you  call  me 
Duffy,  do  you  know  how 
shitty  it  makes  me  feel?” 


Wesley  looked  surprised. 
“What?” 

“Every  time  you  call  me 
that,”  I  said,  “you’re  telling 
me  how  little  you  think  of 
me.  How  ugly  I  am.  God, 
how  can  you  possibly  find  me 
attractive  when  you  put  me 
down  all  the  time .”  I  hissed 
the  last  words  through  gritted 
teeth. 

“I  didn’t — ”  His  eyes  fell, 
staring  at  his  shoes  for  a 


moment.  I  could  tell  he  felt 
guilty.  “Bianca,  I’m  sorry.” 
He  looked  into  my  eyes 
again.  “I  didn’t  mean — ”  His 
hand  reached  out  to  touch  me. 

“Don’t,”  I  snapped, 
shrugging  away  from  him.  I 
slid  to  the  side  and  stepped 
away  from  the  wall.  I  wasn’t 
going  to  be  cornered.  I  wasn’t 
going  to  let  him  have  the 
power  here.  “Just  stop, 
Wesley.” 


It  didn’t  matter  if  some 
part  of  him  found  me 
attractive.  That  didn’t  change 
things.  I  was  just  another  girl 
he’d  slept  with.  One  among 
many. 

“I  didn’t  mean  anything  to 
you,”  I  told  him. 

“Then  why  am  I  here?”  he 
demanded,  turning  to  face  me 
again.  “Why  the  hell  am  I 
here,  Bianca?” 

I  glared  up  at  his  hardened 


face.  “I’ll  tell  you  why.  Your 
parents  leave  you  by  yourself, 
so  you  fill  your  life  with 
meaningless  flings.  With  girls 
you’ll  never  have  anything 
serious  with — girls  who 
practically  worship  you — so 
that  they  don’t  abandon  you. 
The  only  reason  you’re  here 
is  because  you  can’t  take  the 
thought  that  someone  else 
walked  away  from  you.  Your 
sensitive  ego  can’t  handle 


that,  and  it’s  easier  to  make 
me  miss  you  than  to  make 
your  parents  come  home.” 

He  was  speechless,  just 
staring  at  me  with  his  jaw 
visibly  clenching  for  a  few 
seconds. 

“Did  I  hit  the  mark, 
Wesley?”  I  spat.  “Do  I  get 
you  as  well  as  you  think  you 
get  me?” 

He  glared  at  me  for  a  few 
minutes — long  minutes — 


before  stepping  back.  “Fine,” 
he  muttered.  “If  that’s  how 
you  want  it,  I’ll  go.” 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “You 
should.” 

He  turned  and  stormed  out 
of  the  house.  I  heard  the  front 
door  slam,  and  I  knew  he  was 
gone.  For  good.  I  took  a  few 
deep,  slow  breaths  to  clear 
my  head  and  walked  back  up 
to  my  bedroom,  where  Toby 
waited  for  me. 


“Hey,”  I  sighed,  sitting 
down  on  the  bed  beside  him. 
“I’m  so  sorry  about  that.” 

“What  happened?”  he 
asked.  “I  wasn’t 
eavesdropping,  but  there  was 
a  lot  of  yelling.  Are  you 
okay?” 

“I’m  fine,”  I  said.  “It’s  a 
long,  complicated  story.” 

“Well,  if  you  ever  want  to 
talk  about  it” — Toby  adjusted 
his  glasses  and  gave  me  a 


nervous  smile — “I’ve  got  the 
time  to  listen.” 

“Thanks,”  I  said.  “But  I’m 
okay.  Everyone  has  dirty 
laundry,  right?”  Well, 
everyone  except  you,  Toby. 

“Right,”  he  agreed.  He 
leaned  over  and  kissed  me 
gently.  “Sorry  we  were 
interrupted  earlier.” 

“Me,  too.” 

He  pressed  his  lips  to 
mine  again,  but  I  couldn’t 


enjoy  it.  I  just  kept  thinking 
of  Wesley.  He  had  looked  so 
hurt.  But  that’s  what  I  had 
wanted  when  I  left  him,  just  a 
little,  wasn’t  it?  For  him  to 
miss  me?  I  tried  to  push  it 
down,  wanting  so  badly  to 
lose  myself  in  Toby’s  arms. 
But  I  couldn’t. 

Not  the  way  I’d  been  able 
to  lose  myself  with  Wesley. 

I  pulled  away,  disgusted 
with  myself.  How  could  I 


think  of  Wesley  when  I  was 
kissing  a  guy  like  Toby 
Tucker?  What  was  the  matter 
with  me? 

“Is  something  wrong?” 
Toby  asked. 

“It’s  nothing,”  I  lied. 
“Just. . .  we  should  probably 
start  doing  research  for  our 
editorials.” 

“You’re  right.”  He  didn’t 
seem  irritated  or  offended  or 
dejected  at  all.  Perfect 


manners.  A  perfect  smile. 
The  perfect  boy. 

So  why  wasn’t  I  perfectly 
happy? 


24 


Wesley  stayed  on  my  mind 
for  the  next  couple  days, 
which  put  me  in  a  really  pissy 
mood — pissier  than  usual, 
that  is. 

I  didn’t  want  to  think 
about  him.  I  wanted  to  think 
about  Toby,  who  was 


obviously  way  too  good  for 
me.  He  could  tell  I  was 
grumpy,  but  instead  of 
harassing  me  about  the  cause, 
he  just  squeezed  my  hand, 
kissed  me  on  the  cheek,  and 
bought  me  candy  in  hopes  of 
making  me  smile  again.  How 
could  I  be  thinking  of  another 
guy — an  annoying, 
egotistical,  womanizing  guy 
— when  such  a  wonderful  one 


stood  right  in  front  of  me? 


Maybe  someone  needed  to 
slap  me  or  put  me  through 
shock  treatments  like  they 
give  crazy  people  in  the 
movies.  That  might  have 
brought  me  to  my  senses. 

But  Wesley  seemed  to  be 
everywhere.  He  was  always 
climbing  into  his  car  just  as  I 
walked  out  to  the  student 
parking  lot  or  standing  two 
feet  ahead  of  me  in  the  lunch 
line.  Do  you  know  how  hard 


it  is  to  forget  someone  exists 
when  they’re  constantly  in 
your  sight?  Pretty  damn  hard. 
For  a  second,  I  actually 
wondered  if  he  might  be 
doing  this  on  purpose,  like 
stalking  me  or  something,  but 
I  ditched  that  idea  when  I 
noticed  that  he  didn’t  even 
look  at  me  anymore.  Like  he 
was  too  mad  about  the  things 
I’d  said  to  acknowledge  me. 

It  should  have  been  a 


relief  not  to  have  his  creepy 
eyes  crawling  all  over  me,  but 
it  wasn’t  at  all.  It  hurt. 

Every  time  I  saw  Wesley, 

I  was  overcome  with  a  flood 
of  emotions.  Anger,  sadness, 
pain,  irritation,  regret,  lust, 
and,  worst  of  all,  guilt.  I  knew 
I  shouldn’t  have  said  those 
things  about  his  attachment 
issues — even  if  they  were 
totally  true.  And  despite  my 
urge  to  apologize,  I  kept  my 


mouth  shut  tight.  Honestly,  I 
would  rather  have  dealt  with 
the  knowledge  that  I  was  a 
terrible  person  than  suffer 
through  another 
uncomfortable  conversation 
with  him. 

Though  I  couldn’t  avoid 
the  conversation  with  his 
sister. 

I  was  in  the  library  one 
morning,  trying  to  find  a 
book  that  didn’t  contain 


romantic  vampires  or  kids 
flying  on  dragons,  when  Amy 
walked  up  to  me.  I  swear,  she 
was  so  freaking  quiet  that  I 
didn’t  have  a  chance  to  run. 
One  minute  I  was  alone,  the 
next  she  was  right  beside  me. 

I  was  ambushed. 

“B-Bianca,”  she 
stammered.  She  was  wringing 
her  hands  and  staring  at  the 
ground,  as  if  talking  to  me 
was  actually  going  to  kill  her. 


“Oh.  Um,  hey,  Amy.”  I 
shoved  the  book  I  was 
examining  back  onto  the 
shelf.  “What’s  going  on?”  I 
kept  my  face  pointed  away 
from  her,  pretending  I  was 
still  scanning  the  titles  in 
front  of  me. 

I  didn’t  want  to  look  at 
her.  For  one,  she  looked  too 
much  like  her  brother,  and  I 
was  trying — and  failing 
miserably — to  forget  about 


him.  For  another,  I  couldn’t 
stand  to  meet  her  eyes  when 
she  tore  into  me,  which  I  just 
knew  she  was  about  to  do. 

Not  that  I  could  blame  her. 

Well,  okay,  so  I  couldn’t 
really  imagine  timid  little 
Amy  tearing  into  anything, 
but  still. 

“I,  um. . .  I  have  something 
to  say  to  you,”  she  said, 
trying  to  sound  determined. 

Or  maybe  Amy  was  upset 


at  me  for  facilitating 
Wesley’s  “lifestyle.”  Maybe 
she  wanted  to  blame  me  for 
the  distance  between  them. 

If  that  was  the  case,  I 
wanted  to  defend  him.  To  tell 
her  that  her  grandmother  was 
misrepresenting  Wesley.  That 
he  wasn’t  a  bad  guy — and 
definitely  not  a  bad  brother. 
But  I  knew  not  to  get 
involved.  It  wasn’t  my  place 
to  fix  his  family  issues.  He 


wasn’t  even  part  of  my  life 
anymore. 

“Okay.  Go  ahead.” 

Here  it  comes,  I  thought. 
Whatever  she  says,  don ’t  cry. 

“I...  I  want  to...”  She 
took  a  deep  breath.  “Thank 
you.” 

“Huh?”  I  turned  around  to 
face  her.  Surely  I  hadn’t 
heard  her  right.  There  was 
just  no  way. 

“Thank  you,”  she 


repeated.  “For  Wesley.  He. . . 
he’s  a  lot  different,  and  I 
know  it  has  to  be  because  of 
you.  I. . .  I  appreciate  it,  so 
thank  you.” 

Before  I  could  ask  for  a 
detailed  explanation — spoken 
slowly  so  that  I  could  follow 
— Amy  turned  around  and 
hurried  away,  her  brown  curls 
bouncing  behind  her. 

I  was  left  standing  in  the 
middle  of  the  library,  totally 


confused. 

And  it  got  worse  later  that 
day. 

When  Wesley  rounded  the 
corner  after  lunch  while  I  was 
pulling  notebooks  out  of  my 
locker,  I  wasn’t  really 
surprised.  Like  I  said,  he  was 
everywhere.  Vikki  was  with 
him,  clinging  to  his  arm  and 
flipping  her  hair  like  the  girl 
in  a  shampoo  commercial. 

She  was  laughing,  but  I  could 


have  bet  money  that  whatever 
Wesley  had  said  wasn’t  all 
that  funny.  She  just  wanted  to 
inflate  his  ego. . .  as  if  it 
needed  to  get  any  bigger. 

“Over  here,”  she  giggled, 
pulling  him  into  the  alcove 
ten  feet  away  from  me.  “I 
wanna  talk  to  you.” 

Talk?  I  thought.  Yeah,  not 
likely. 

I  swear,  I  tried  not  to 
listen.  I  knew  hearing  them 


flirt  would  only  get  me 
worked  up,  but  Vikki’s 
squeaky  voice  carries,  and 
they  were  standing  really 
close  to  me,  and  yeah,  a 
masochistic  little  part  of  me 
couldn’t  stop  myself.  I  started 
arranging  the  textbooks  in  the 
bottom  of  my  locker,  trying 
to  make  enough  noise  that  I 
wouldn’t  be  able  to  hear  their 
conversation. 

“What  are  you  doing  for 


prom?”  Vikki  asked. 

“I  don’t  have  any  plans,” 
Wesley  answered. 

I  shuffled  my  papers 
loudly,  hoping  that,  even  if  I 
couldn’t  drown  out  their 
words,  they  would  notice  me 
and  take  the  make-out  session 
elsewhere.  I  mean,  they 
weren’t  groping  each  other 
yet,  but  I  knew  both  of  them 
well  enough  to  be  sure  it 
wouldn’t  take  long. 


“Well,”  Vikki  said,  either 
not  hearing  me  or  just  not 
caring.  “I  thought  maybe  we 
could  go  together.”  I  didn’t 
have  to  look  to  know  she  was 
scraping  her  long,  polished 
fingernails  lightly  down 
Wesley’s  arm.  Vikki  used  the 
same  moves  on  every  guy.  “I 
thought  maybe  after  the 
dance  we  could  have  a  little 
time  alone. . .  at  your  place, 
maybe?” 


I  had  the  serious  desire  to 
puke.  I  grabbed  my  books, 
slammed  my  locker  shut,  and 
prepared  to  bolt  toward  my 
next  class  before  I  had  to  hear 
Wesley  say  yes.  Let  them 
have  each  other !  I  thought 
bitterly.  STDs  all  around !  To 
hell  with  it.  But  he  answered 
before  I  could  even  take  a 
step. 

“I  don’t  think  so,  Vikki.” 

I  froze. 


What?  What?  Rewind  for 
a  second,  please.  Did  Wesley 
really  turn  down  a  girl?  A  girl 
who  was  perfectly  willing  to 
fuck  his  brains  out?  I  had  to 
be  dreaming. 

Vikki  seemed  to  be 
experiencing  a  similar 
reaction.  “What?  What  do 
you  mean?” 

“I’m  just  not  interested,” 
Wesley  said.  “But  I’m  sure 
you  have  plenty  of  other  boys 


who  would  love  to  join  you. 
Sorry.” 

“Oh.”  Vikki  stumbled  out 
of  the  alcove  with  a  look  of 
hurt  surprise.  “It’s,  um,  okay. 
Not  a  problem.  Just  thought 
I’d  offer.”  She  hesitated  for  a 
second.  “I  guess  I’ll  see  you 
later?  Gotta  go  to  class.  Bye.” 
And  she  took  off  down  the 
hall,  obviously  confused. 

She  wasn’t  the  only  one. 

Was  this  the  difference 


Amy  had  been  talking  about? 
Was  Wesley  suddenly 
inclined  to  be  less  man- 
whorish?  If  so,  how  was  that 
because  of  me? 

I  stared  as  Wesley  walked 
out  of  the  alcove.  Then,  for 
the  first  time  in  days,  he 
looked  at  me.  His  eyes  locked 
with  mine.  A  weak  smile 
tugged  at  the  corners  of  his 
mouth,  but  the  expression  in 
his  eyes  was  unreadable.  I 


could  tell  he  wasn’t  angry, 
though.  That  fact  sent  instant 
relief  through  my  tense 
muscles. 

Knowing  he  wasn’t  pissed 
at  me  made  the  guilt  ebb  a 
little. . .  but  not  entirely.  I’d 
still  said  some  cold  things  to 
him,  and  in  that  second,  as  I 
held  his  gaze,  I  thought  of 
speaking,  of  apologizing.  I 
thought  about  it,  but  I  didn’t 
say  a  word. 


Wesley  took  a  step  toward 
me,  and  I  suddenly 
remembered  who  I  was — who 
he  was.  While  Wesley’s 
rejecting  Vikki  was 
undeniably  surprising,  it 
didn’t  change  the  fact  that  I 
didn’t  have  a  chance  with 
him;  he  would  never  want  a 
real  relationship. . .  especially 
not  with  me.  And  then  there 
was  the  fact  that  I  was  dating 
Toby.  Plus,  I  knew  that 


communicating  with  Wesley 
would  just  make  my  steadily 
improving  life  complicated 
again.  I  wouldn’t  punish 
myself  that  way. 

I  spun  around  and  started 
running  down  the  hallway, 
pretending  I  didn’t  hear  him 
call  after  me. 

I  slowed  when  I  turned 
down  another  hallway  and 
saw  Toby  (my  boyfriend?  I 
wasn’t  sure  how  this  worked) 


waiting  for  me  by  the  old, 
out-of-order  snack  machines. 
He  smiled  and  adjusted  his 
glasses,  and  I  could  tell  he 
was  genuinely  pleased  to  see 
me.  Was  I  equally  happy  to 
see  him?  I  was.  Of  course  I 
was,  but  the  smile  on  my  face 
felt  artificial. 

Toby’s  arm  wrapped 
around  my  shoulders  when  I 
got  close  enough.  “Hey.” 

“Hi,”  I  sighed. 


He  leaned  down  and 
kissed  me  on  the  lips  before 
asking,  “Is  it  okay  if  I  walk 
you  to  class?” 

I  glanced  over  my 
shoulder  at  the  emptying 
hallway.  “Sure,”  I  murmured, 
facing  forward  again.  I  leaned 
my  head  on  his  shoulder. 
“That  sounds. . .  perfect.” 

A  few  days  later,  I  found 
Jessica  waiting  for  me  outside 


my  third-block  calculus  class. 
“Can  we  talk  on  the  way  to 
English?”  she  asked  without 
the  usual  bob  in  her  step  or 
swing  to  her  hair.  I  could  tell 
something  was  up  by  the  way 
she  bit  her  lower  lip. 

“Um,  sure,”  I  said, 
shifting  my  books  under  my 
right  arm.  Seeing  my 
perpetually  perky  friend 
looking  so  solemn  made  me 
uneasy.  “Is  something 


wrong?” 

“Kinda,. . .  not  really.” 

We  shoved  our  way 
through  the  packed  halls 
together,  trying  not  to  step  on 
too  many  people’s  toes.  I 
waited  for  Jessica  to  speak, 
my  curiosity  and  anxiety 
rising.  I  really  wanted  to  say, 
“Hurry  up!  Out  with  it!” 
Luckily,  though,  she  started 
talking  before  my  legendary 
low  patience  ran  out. 


“It’s  about  you  and  Toby. 
I  just  don’t  think  you’re  right 
together.”  She  said  it  so  fast 
that  I  wasn’t  sure  if  I’d  heard 
her  at  first.  “I’m  sorry, 
Bianca,”  she  moaned.  “It’s 
not  any  of  my  business,  but  I 
don’t  see  a  spark  there,  you 
know?  And  Casey  totally 
disagrees  with  me.  She  says 
you’re  better  with  Toby,  and 
she  might  be  right,  but. . .  I 
don’t  know.  You  don’t  seem 


like  yourself  when  you’re 
with  him.  Please  don’t  be 
mad.” 

I  shook  my  head,  trying  to 
fight  my  sudden  urge  to 
laugh.  That  was  it?  That  was 
what  she  was  worried  about? 
I’d  seriously  thought 
someone  was  dying  or,  at  the 
least,  her  Mom  had  forbidden 
her  going  to  prom.  Instead,  it 
turned  out  that  she  was 
worried  about  me.  “Jessica, 


I’m  not  mad  at  you  at  all.” 

“Oh,  good,”  she  breathed. 
“I  was  really  scared  you 
would  get  p.o.’ed  at  me.” 

Ouch.  Was  I  that  bitchy? 
So  horrible  that  one  of  my 
best  friends  was  afraid  to  tell 
me  her  opinion  because  I 
might  go  into  a  rage  or 
something?  God,  that  made 
me  feel  like  shit. 

“It’s  not  that  I  don’t  like 
Toby,”  Jessica  continued.  “I 


do.  He’s  sweet,  and  he’s  nice 
to  you,  and  I  know  you  need 
that  after. . .  after  my  brother.” 

My  heart  may  have 
actually  stopped  beating  for  a 
second  there.  I  stopped  right 
where  I  was  and,  after  a 
stunned  pause,  whirled 
around  to  stare  at  Jessica. 
“How  do  you. . .?”  I  managed 
to  whisper. 

“Jake  told  me,”  she  said. 

“I  was  telling  him  about  my 


friends  when  your  name  came 
up,  and  he  told  me  about  your 
thing  a  few  years  ago.  He 
feels  horrible  about  it  now, 
and  he  wanted  me  to 
apologize  for  him,  but  I 
didn’t  want  to  bring  it  up.  I’m 
sorry,  Bianca.  It  must  be 
really  hard  for  you  to  be  my 
friend  after  what  Jake  did.” 


“That’s  not  your  fault.” 
“I  just  can’t  believe  you 
didn’t  say  anything.  It  must 


have  been  on  your  mind  when 
Jake  came  to  visit.  Why 
didn’t  you  tell  me?” 

“I  didn’t  want  you  to  think 
less  of  your  brother,”  I  said. 

“I  know  you  think  a  lot  of 
him,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  ruin 
that.” 

Jessica  didn’t  say 
anything.  She  stepped 
forward  and  wrapped  her 
arms  around  me,  hugging  me 
as  close  to  her  as  humanly 


possible.  It  was  a  little 
awkward  at  first,  especially 
considering  the  fact  that 
Jessica’s  giant  boobs  were 
practically  smothering  me, 
but  I  gradually  fell  into  her 
embrace.  My  arms  slid 
around  her  waist,  returning 
the  hug.  Knowing  I  had 
someone  who  would  hold  me 
like  this,  with  nothing  to  gain, 
made  me  feel  like  one  of  the 
luckiest  people  in  the  world. 


“I  love  you,  Bianca.” 

“Um,  what  was  that?” 

Jessica  released  me  and 
took  a  step  back.  “I  love 
you,”  she  said.  “You  and 
Casey  both.  You’re  the  best 
friends  I’ve  ever  had,  and  I 
don’t  know  where  I’d  be  if 
you  two  hadn’t  come  along 
my  sophomore  year.  I’d 
probably  still  be  letting  those 
preppy  girls  walk  all  over 
me.”  She  looked  down  at  her 


feet.  “You  two  always  try  to 
protect  me,  like  not  telling  me 
about  what  an  a-hole  my 
brother  was.  And  I  want  to  do 
the  same  thing  for  you.” 

“Jessica,  that’s  sweet.” 

“That’s  why  I’m  telling 
you  this,”  she  went  on.  “I 
know  Toby  is  nice  and  he 
likes  you,  but  I  don’t  see  a 
connection.  I  mean,  I’m  glad 
you’re  spending  time  with  me 
and  Casey  again,  and  I  think 


it’s  cool  that  he  hangs  out 
with  us  sometimes,  but  what  I 
care  about  is  that  you’re 
happy.  You  might  look 
happy,  but  I  don’t  think  you 
are.”  She  took  a  deep  breath 
and  tugged  at  the  hem  of  her 
floral-print  skirt.  “I  don’t 
want  to  bring  this  up,  but. . . 
I’ve  heard  some  rumors  about 
Wesley  lately.” 

I  bit  my  lip.  “Oh.” 

“He  hasn’t  been  as  flirty 


lately,”  she  said.  “I  haven’t 
seen  him  with  any  girls,  and  I 
thought” — she  looked  at  me 
with  wide  chocolate  eyes — “I 
thought  maybe  you’d  want  to 
know.  I  mean,  I  know  you 
have  feelings  for  him,  and — ” 
I  shook  my  head.  “No,”  I 
said,  “it’s  not  that  simple.” 

She  nodded.  “Okay,”  she 
said.  “I  just  thought  I’d  throw 
it  out  there.  Sorry.” 

I  sighed  and  smiled, 


reaching  out  to  take  her  hand 
and  pulling  her  toward  the 
English  classroom.  “It’s  okay. 
I  appreciate  you  being 
concerned — I  really,  really 
do.  And  you  might  be  right. . . 
about  me  and  Toby,  I  mean. 
But  this  is  just  high  school. 
We’re  only  dating.  It’s  not 
like  I’m  looking  for  a 
husband  or  whatever.  I  don’t 
think  you  need  to  worry  about 
me  yet.  I’m  fine.” 


“Casey  says  you’re 
usually  lying  when  you  say 
that,”  Jessica  informed  me. 

“She  does,  huh?” 

I  released  Jessica’s  hand 
as  we  walked  into  English 
class,  determined  to  avoid 
answering  her  accusation. 
That  proved  to  be  pretty  easy, 
really.  I  was  able  to  feign 
distraction — well,  it  wasn’t 
entirely  fake — when  I  noticed 
the  folded  piece  of  paper 


lying  on  my  desk.  I  sat  down 
and  picked  it  up,  assuming  it 
was  from  Casey.  Who  else 
would  be  writing  me  a  note? 

But  Casey  always  drew  a 
smiley  face  over  the  i  in  my 
name,  and  the  handwriting  on 
the  outside  of  this  paper  was 
small,  cursive,  and  faceless. 

Confused,  I  unfolded  the 
paper  and  read  the  single 
sentence  that  was  scrawled 
across  the  top. 


Wesley  Rush  doesn’t  chase  girls, 
but  I’m  chasing  you. 


25 


At  one  time,  I  thought  being 
the  Duff  meant  no  boy  drama. 
Clearly,  I  was  wrong.  How 
did  this  happen?  How  did  I, 
the  ugly  girl,  end  up  in  the 
middle  of  a  love  triangle?  I 
wasn’t  a  romantic.  I  didn’t 
really  even  want  to  date.  But 


there  I  was,  tom  between  two 
attractive  guys  that,  by  all 
means,  I  shouldn’t  have  had  a 
shot  with.  (Tmst  me,  not  as 
glamorous  as  it  sounds.) 

On  one  side,  I  had  Toby. 
Smart,  cute,  funny,  polite, 
sensitive,  and  practical.  Toby 
was  perfect  in  every 
conceivable  way.  I  mean,  he 
was  a  little  dorky,  but  that 
was  what  made  him  so 
adorable.  I  liked  being  with 


him,  and  he  always  put  me 
first.  He  respected  me  and 
never  seemed  to  lose  his 
patience.  There  was 
absolutely  nothing  to 
complain  about  with  Toby 
Tucker. 

On  the  other  side,  there 
was  Wesley.  A  jerk.  An 
asshole.  An  arrogant, 
womanizing  rich  boy  who  put 
sex  before  everything  else. 
Sure,  he  was  incredibly  hot, 


but  he  could  annoy  the  hell 
out  of  me.  He  was  irritatingly 
charming,  and  his  cute  little 
grin  could  really  get  under 
my  skin.  But  he  had  a  way  of 
making  my  heart  race  and  my 
head  spin.  I  wasn’t  afraid  to 
be  a  bitch  around  him.  I  hated 
to  admit  it,  but  Wesley 
understood  me.  I  felt  like 
myself  when  I  was  with  him, 
whereas  I  was  always  trying 
to  hide  my  neuroses  around 


Toby. 

God,  life  had  been  so 
much  easier  when  no  one 
noticed  me. 

The  note  from  Wesley 
weighed  half  a  ton  in  my 
back  pocket  as  I  headed  out 
to  the  student  parking  lot  that 
afternoon.  To  say  I  was 
confused  would  have  been  a 
massive  understatement.  I 
mean,  that  single  sentence  left 
me  with  a  million  different 


questions,  but  there  was  one 
in  particular: 

Why  the  hell  does  Wesley 
want  me? 

Seriously.  The  guy  had 
dozens  of  girls  who  would 
kill  to  be  with  him.  Why  me? 
Wasn’t  he  the  one  who  had 
called  me  the  Duff  in  the  first 
place?  What  the  fuck? 

But  when  I  got  home,  it 
just  got  worse. 

On  Toby’s  suggestion,  I’d 


started  reading  Wuthering 
Heights  in  my  spare  time. 
Honestly,  the  main  characters 
pissed  me  off  so  much  that  it 
was  hard  to  push  through  the 
book.  I  was  considering 
putting  it  down  for  good  that 
day,  but  a  line  of  dialogue 
caught  my  attention. 

“My  love  for  Linton  is  like 
the  foliage  in  the  woods.  Time 
will  change  it,  Fm  well 
aware,  as  winter  changes  the 


trees — my  love  for  Heathcliff 
resembles  the  eternal  rocks 
beneath — a  source  of  little 
visible  delight,  but 
necessary.  ” 

As  stupid  as  it  sounds,  that 
little  excerpt  really  got  in  my 
head,  like  a  song  you  hate  but 
can’t  stop  singing.  I  tried  to 
read  on,  but  the  words  kept 
bouncing  around  in  my  brain. 
I  turned  back  the  page  and 
read  the  lines  again  and 


again.  I  was  trying  to  figure 
out  why  they  bugged  me  so 
much  when  I  was  interrupted 
by  the  sound  of  the  doorbell. 

“Thank  God,”  I  muttered, 
relieved  to  have  a  reason  to 
slam  the  book  shut.  I  jumped 
off  my  bed  and  ran 
downstairs.  “Coming!”  I 
yelled.  “Just  a  second!” 

I  pulled  open  the  front 
door,  expecting  to  find  Toby, 
who’d  said  he  might  drop  by 


later.  But  the  man  on  my 
front  porch  was  a  chubby 
redhead  in  his  fifties. 
Definitely  not  my  boyfriend. 
He  wore  a  shabby  green 
uniform  and  a  hat  that  didn’t 
quite  fit.  The  name  tag  on  his 
jacket  read  JIMMY.  He  was 
holding  a  bouquet  of  flowers 
in  his  right  hand  and  a 
clipboard  was  wedged  under 
his  arm. 

“Are  you  Miss  Bianca 


Piper?”  he  asked. 

“Um...  yeah.” 

His  squinty  eyes  lighted 
with  a  smile.  “Sign  this, 
please,”  he  said,  giving  me 
the  clipboard  and  a  pen. 
“Congratulations.” 

“Er,  thanks,”  I  said, 
handing  the  clipboard  back  to 
him. 

He  passed  me  the  bouquet, 
which  I  now  saw  was  full  of 
real  red  roses,  and  produced  a 


white  envelope  from  his  back 
pocket.  “This  is  for  you,  too,” 
he  said.  “You’re  a  lucky  girl. 
It’s  not  often  I  get  to  make  a 
delivery  like  this  to  someone 
your  age.”  He  smiled. 

“Young  love.” 

Young  love?  God,  I  had  to 
fight  the  urge  to  correct  him. 
To  give  him  my  long  speech 
about  how  teenagers  don’t 
fall  in  love.  But  he  was  still 
talking. 


“Your  boyfriend  must 
really  be  a  keeper.  Not  many 
boys  are  so  thoughtful  at  that 
age.” 

I  stared  down  at  the  roses 
and  said,  “You’re  probably 
right.”  Was  Toby  still  trying 
to  cheer  me  up?  God,  he  was 
so  nice.  Too  bad  I  didn’t 
deserve  all  of  the  kindness. 

After  thanking  the 
delivery  guy,  I  closed  the 
door.  I  felt  guilty  for 


considering  my  situation  a 
love  triangle.  It  was  just  me 
and  Toby,  and  Wesley  danced 
along  the  outskirts,  far  away 
from  us. . .  or  that’s  how  it 
should  have  been.  That’s  how 
Toby  deserved  for  it  to  be. 

I  put  the  bouquet  on  the 
kitchen  table  and  opened  the 
envelope,  expecting  to  find  a 
sappy  but  perfectly  worded 
letter  from  my  flawless 
boyfriend.  It  was  the  kind  of 


thing  I’d  normally  scoff  at, 
but  I’d  let  Toby  get  away 
with  it.  He  really  did  have  a 
way  with  words  sometimes. 
That  would  help  when  he 
became  a  famous  politician. 

But  the  handwriting  on  the 
letter  was  the  same  as  the 
note  in  my  back  pocket.  This 
time,  however,  there  was 
much  more  to  absorb. 


Bianca, 


Since  you  keep  running 
away  from  me  at  school,  and, 
if  I  remember  correctly,  the 
sound  of  my  voice  causes  you 
to  have  suicidal  thoughts,  I 
decided  a  letter  might  be  the 
best  way  to  tell  you  how  I  feel. 
Just  hear  me  out. 

I’m  not  going  to  deny  that 
you  were  right.  Everything  you 
said  the  other  day  was  true. 

But  my  fear  of  being  alone  is 
not  the  reason  I’m  pursuing 
you.  I  know  how  cynical  you 
are,  and  you’re  probably  going 
to  come  up  with  some  snarky 
reply  when  you  read  this,  but 


the  truth  is,  I’m  chasing  you 
because  I  really  think  I  am 
falling  in  love  with  you. 

You  are  the  first  girl  who 
has  ever  seen  right  through  me. 
You’re  the  only  girl  who  has 
ever  called  me  on  my  bullshit. 
You  put  me  in  my  place,  but, 
at  the  same  time,  you 
understand  me  better  than 
anyone  ever  has.  You  are  the 
only  person  brave  enough  to 
criticize  me.  Maybe  the  only 
person  who  looks  close  enough 
to  find  my  faults — and,  clearly, 
you’ve  found  many. 

I  called  my  parents. 


They’re  coming  home  this 
weekend  to  talk  to  Amy  and 
me.  I  was  afraid  to  do  this  at 
first,  but  you  inspired  me. 
Without  you,  I  never  could 
have  done  that. 

I  think  about  you  much 
more  than  any  self-respecting 
man  would  like  to  admit,  and 
I’m  insanely  jealous  of  Tucker 
— something  I  never  thought 
I’d  say.  Moving  on  after  you  is 
impossible.  No  other  girl  can 
keep  me  on  my  toes  the  way 
you  can.  No  one  else  makes 
me  WANT  to  embarrass 
myself  by  writing  sappy  letters 


like  this  one. 

Only  you. 

But  I  know  that  I’m  right, 
too.  I  know  you’re  in  love  with 
me,  even  if  you  are  dating 
Tucker.  You  can  lie  to  yourself 
if  you  want,  but  reality  is  going 
to  catch  up  with  you.  I’ll  be 
waiting  when  it  does. . . 
whether  you  like  it  or  not. 

Love, 

Wesley 

p.s.:  I  know  you’re  rolling  your 
eyes  right  now,  but  I  don’t 
care.  Honestly,  it’s  always 
been  kind  of  a  turn-on. 


I  stared  down  at  the  letter  for 
a  long  moment,  finally 
understanding  what  Amy  had 
been  thanking  me  for.  Wesley 
was  trying  to  fix  things . . . 
because  of  me.  Because  of 
what  I’d  said.  I’d  actually 
managed  to  get  through  that 
thick  skull  of  his.  That  was 
absolutely  shocking  to  me. 

It  took  a  second  for  the 
other  surprises  to  sink  in. 
Words  like  love  and  only 


leapt  off  the  page  at  me.  It 
was  my  first  love  letter — not 
that  I’d  ever  wanted  one,  but 
still — and  it  wasn’t  even  from 
my  boyfriend.  The  wrong  guy 
had  given  it  to  me.  The  wrong 
guy  wanted  me.  Wesley  was 
the  wrong  guy. 

Or  was  he  exactly  the 
right  guy? 

I  was  so  consumed  with 
my  thoughts  that  I  jumped 
when  the  phone  rang,  and  I 


scurried  across  the  linoleum 
in  an  effort  to  answer  it. 
“Hello?” 

“Hi,  Bianca,”  Toby  said. 

My  heart  sped  up  and 
pumped  shame  through  my 
veins.  Wesley’s  letter,  which 
I  still  held,  burned  the  fingers 
of  my  right  hand,  but  I 
managed  to  sound  normal 
when  I  said,  “Hey,  Toby.  Are 
you  on  your  way  over?” 

“No,”  he  sighed.  “Dad  has 


errands  for  me  to  run,  so  I 
can’t  come  by  this  afternoon. 
I’m  really  sorry.” 

“That’s  okay.”  I  shouldn’t 
have  felt  relieved,  but  I  was. 
Seeing  Toby  would  have 
meant  hiding  the  flowers  and 
entering  a  potential  web  of 
lies,  and  we  all  know  what  a 
shitty  liar  I  am.  “Don’t  worry 
about  it.” 

“Thanks  for  being  so 
understanding.  But  I  was 


really  looking  forward  to 
spending  a  little  time  with 
you.  We  just  don’t  get  much 
time  together  at  school.”  He 
paused.  “Do  you  have  plans 
tomorrow  night?” 

“Nope.” 

“Then  do  you  want  to  go 
on  a  date?  A  band  is  playing 
at  the  Nest,  and  I  thought  we 
could  go.  Of  course  your 
friends  can  come,  too.  Would 
you  like  that?” 


“Sounds  great.”  See,  little 
lies  like  that  I  could  pull  off.  I 
hated  live  music,  and  I 
despised  the  Nest,  but 
pretending  the  opposite 
would  make  Toby  happy,  and 
Casey  would  be  thrilled  to  be 
invited  along.  So  why  not? 
White  lies  were  easy  enough, 
but  anything  bigger  and  I  was 
screwed. 

“Cool,”  Toby  said.  “I’ll 
pick  you  up  at  eight.” 


“Okay.  Bye,  Toby.” 

“I’ll  see  you  tomorrow, 
Bianca.” 

I  hung  up  the  phone,  but 
my  feet  refused  to  move.  The 
letter  still  blazed  against  my 
skin,  and  I  found  myself 
staring  down  at  the  tempting 
words.  Why  wasn’t  this 
easier?  Why  did  Wesley  have 
to  come  along  and  make  me 
question  everything?  I  felt 
like  I  was  betraying  Toby 


with  every  sentence  I  read. 
Like  I  was  cheating  on  him. 

But  now  I  knew  that  every 
time  I  kissed  Toby,  I  was 
hurting  Wesley. 

“Arrrrrgh!”  With  a  scream 
that  exploded  in  my  chest  and 
clawed  its  way  through  my 
lungs,  I  wadded  the  letter  into 
a  tight  ball  and  hurled  it 
across  the  room  as  hard  as  I 
could.  It  moved  through  the 
air  slowly  before  bouncing 


delicately  off  the  floral 
wallpaper  and  landing  on  the 
floor. 

Finally,  with  my  throat 
aching,  I  sank  to  the  floor, 
buried  my  face  in  my  hands, 
and — I  admit  it — cried.  I 
cried  out  of  frustration  and 
confusion,  but  mostly  for 
myself,  for  being  caught  in 
such  a  position,  like  the 
selfish  little  girl  I  was. 

I  thought  of  Cathy 


Earnshaw,  the  spoiled,  selfish 
heroine  in  Wuthering 
Heights,  and  I  remembered 
the  passage  I’d  been  reading 
before  the  doorbell  rang.  But 
when  the  words  drifted 
through  my  brain,  they  were 
slightly  different. 

“My  love  for  Toby  is  like  the 
foliage  in  the  woods.  Time 
will  change  it,  I’m  well 
aware,  as  winter  changes  the 
trees — my  love  for  Wesley 


resembles  the  eternal  rocks 
beneath — a  source  of  little 
visible  delight,  but 
necessary.  ” 

My  head  shook  back  and 
forth  feverishly.  Like,  I 
corrected  myself.  My  like  for 
Wesley  is  blah,  blah,  blah.  I 
wiped  my  eyes  and  got  to  my 
feet,  trying  to  calm  my 
ragged  breathing.  Then  I 
turned  and  walked  back 
upstairs. 


All  of  a  sudden  I  wanted 
to  know  how  the  book  ended. 


26 


After  staying  up  all  night  to 
read — and  folding  my  clothes 
at  least  ten  times — I 
discovered  that  Wuthering 
Heights  doesn’t  have  a  happy 
ending.  Because  of  stupid, 
spoiled,  selfish  Cathy  (yeah,  I 
have  no  room  to  talk,  but 


still),  everyone  winds  up 
miserable.  Her  choice  mins 
the  lives  of  the  people  she 
cares  most  about.  Because 
she  picked  propriety  over 
passion.  Head  over  heart. 
Linton  over  Heathcliff. 

Toby  over  Wesley. 

This,  I  decided  as  I 
dragged  my  tired  ass  to 
school  the  next  morning,  was 
not  a  good  omen.  Normally,  I 
don’t  believe  in  omens  or 


signs  or  any  of  that  destiny 
crap,  but  the  similarities 
between  my  and  Cathy 
Earnshaw’s  situations  were 
too  eerie  to  ignore.  I  couldn’t 
help  but  wonder  if  the  book 
was  trying  to  tell  me 
something. 

I  was  dully  aware  that  I 
was  reading  way  too  much 
into  it,  but  my  lack  of  sleep 
coupled  with  the  stress  of 
everything  else  made  my 


mind  go  to  some  interesting 
places.  Interesting,  but  not 
productive. 

I  was  pretty  much  a 
zombie  all  day,  but  during  the 
middle  of  calculus,  something 
finally  woke  me  up. 

“Did  you  hear  about  Vikki 
McPhee?” 

“About  how  she’s  totally 
knocked  up?  Yep.  Heard  this 
morning.” 

My  head  snapped  up  from 


the  problem  I  was 
halfheartedly  attempting  to 
solve.  Two  girls  sat  side  by 
side  in  the  row  ahead  of  me.  I 
recognized  one  of  them  as  a 
junior  cheerleader. 

“God,  what  a  slut,”  the 
cheerleader  said.  “No  telling 
who  the  father  is.  She  sleeps 
with  everyone.” 

I  hate  to  admit  it,  but  my 
first  reaction  to  this  was  pure 
selfish  fear.  I  thought  of 


Wesley.  Sure,  he’d  rejected 
Vikki  in  the  hallway  a  few 
days  ago,  but  what  if 
something  had  changed? 
What  if  that  letter  had  been  a 
joke?  A  game  to  mess  with 
my  head?  What  if  he  and 
Vikki  had... 

I  forced  the  thought  away. 
Wesley  was  careful.  He 
always  used  a  condom. 
Besides,  it  was  like  that  girl 
had  said — Vikki  slept  with 


everyone.  The  chances  of 
Wesley  being  the  father  were 
slim.  And  I  didn’t  have  a 
right  to  worry  about  that, 
anyway.  He  wasn’t  my 
boyfriend.  Even  if  he  had 
pretty  much  professed  his 
love  for  me  in  a  letter.  I  was 
with  Toby,  and  whatever 
Wesley  decided  to  do  wasn’t 
any  of  my  business. 

My  second  thought  was  of 
Vikki.  Seventeen,  on  the 


verge  of  graduation,  and,  if 
the  rumors  were  true, 
pregnant.  What  a  nightmare. 
And  everyone  knew.  I  could 
hear  people  buzzing  about  it 
in  the  hallway  when  I  left 
calculus.  In  a  school  the  size 
of  Hamilton,  it  didn’t  take 
long  for  gossip  to  spread. 
Vikki  McPhee  was  the  girl  on 
everyone’s  mind. 

Including  mine. 

So  when  I  walked  out  of  a 


bathroom  stall  a  few  minutes 
before  English  and  found 
Vikki  standing  at  the  sink, 
reapplying  her  dark  pink 
lipstick,  I  had  to  make  an 
effort  to  avert  my  eyes. 

But  I  had  to  say 
something.  I  mean,  we 
weren’t  close  or  anything,  but 
we  did  eat  lunch  together 
every  day.  “Hey,”  I  mumbled. 

“Hey,”  she  replied,  still 
tracing  the  lipstick  across  her 


lower  lip. 

I  turned  on  the  faucet  and 
stared  at  my  reflection  in  the 
mirror,  trying  hard  not  to 
sneak  a  peek  at  her.  How  far 
along  was  she?  Had  her 
parents  found  out  yet? 

“It’s  not  true,  you  know.” 

“What?” 

Vikki  capped  her  lipstick 
and  dropped  it  into  her  purse. 
She  was  watching  me  in  the 
mirror,  and  I  could  see  now 


that  her  eyes  were  a  little  red. 

“I’m  not  pregnant,”  she 
said.  “I  mean,  I  thought  I  was, 
but  the  test  was  negative.  I 
took  it  two  days  ago.  But  I 
guess  someone  overheard  me 
telling  Jeanine  and  Angela 
and. . .  whatever.  But  I’m  not 
pregnant.” 

“Oh.  Well,  that’s  good.” 
Yeah,  probably  not  exactly 
the  right  thing  to  say,  but  I 
was  kind  of  caught  off  guard. 


Vikki  nodded  and  tugged 
at  one  of  her  strawberry- 
blond  curls  a  little.  “I  was 
relieved.  I  don’t  know  how  I 
would  have  told  my  parents. 
And  the  guy  never  would 
have  made  a  good  father.” 

“Who?” 

That  was  such  a  selfish 
question. 

“Just  this  guy. . .  Eric.” 

Thank  God,  I  thought. 
Then,  of  course,  I  felt 


incredibly  guilty.  This  wasn’t 
the  time  to  be  thinking  about 
myself. 

“He’s  just  this  stupid  frat 
boy  who  gets  a  kick  out  of 
fucking  high  school  girls.” 
She  looked  down,  so  I 
couldn’t  see  her  eyes  in  the 
mirror  anymore.  “And  I 
didn’t  even  give  a  shit.  I  just 
let  him  use  me,  and  I  never 
thought. . .  even  when  the 
condom  broke. . .”  She  trailed 


off,  shaking  her  head. 
“Anyway,  I’m  glad  it  was 
negative.” 

“Right.” 

“It  is  scary,  though,”  she 
said.  “I  freaked  out  when  I 
was  waiting  for  the  test.  I  just 
couldn’t  believe  I  was  in  that 
situation,  you  know?” 

“I’m  sure,”  I  said,  but  I 
didn’t  find  it  all  that 
surprising.  It  was  Vikki,  after 
all.  Hadn’t  she  been  setting 


herself  up  for  that  kind  of 
thing  for  a  while?  Sleeping 
with  people  she  didn’t  care 
about.  Forgetting  about  the 
consequences. 

Just  like  I  did... 

Okay,  so  it  hadn’t  been 
people.  Wesley  was  the  only 
guy.  And  I  did  care  about 
him. . .  now,  after  I’d  stopped 
sleeping  with  him.  But  that 
was  just. . .  well,  I  didn’t 
know  what  you’d  call  it.  Not 


quite  luck.  Maybe 
coincidence?  Either  way,  I 
was  smart  enough  to  know 
that  it  didn’t  happen  often. 

But  I  had  forgotten  about 
the  consequences.  And  it 
suddenly  hit  me  how  easily 
Vikki  and  I  could  trade 
places.  I  could  have  been  the 
girl  everyone  was  talking 
about.  I  could  have  had  a 
pregnancy  scare.  Or  worse.  I 
mean,  I  was  on  birth  control, 


and  Wesley  and  I  were 
always  safe,  but  these  things 
fail  sometimes.  It  could  easily 
have  failed  for  us.  And  yet 
there  I  was,  judging  Vikki  for 
pretty  much  the  same  thing.  I 
was  a  hell  of  a  hypocrite. 

“ You  are  not  a  whore.  ”  I 
had  a  sudden  flash  of  Wesley 
that  last  night  in  his  bedroom, 
telling  me  exactly  who  I  was. 
Telling  me  that  the  rest  of  the 
world  was  just  as  confused  as 


me.  That  I  wasn’t  a  whore, 
and  I  wasn’t  alone. 

I  didn’t  know  Vikki  that 
well.  I  didn’t  know  what  her 
home  life  was  like  or 
anything  that  personal  aside 
from  her  boy  issues.  And 
standing  there  in  the 
bathroom,  listening  as  she 
told  me  her  story,  I  couldn’t 
help  but  wonder  if  she’d  been 
running  away  from 
something,  too.  If  I’d  been 


judging  her,  thinking  of  her 
as  a  slut  all  this  time  when,  in 
reality,  we  were  living  scarily 
similar  lives. 

Calling  Vikki  a  slut  or  a 
whore  was  just  like  calling 
someone  the  Duff.  It  was 
insulting  and  hurtful,  and  it 
was  one  of  those  titles  that 
just  fed  off  of  an  inner  fear 
every  girl  must  have  from 
time  to  time.  Slut,  bitch, 
prude,  tease,  ditz.  They  were 


all  the  same.  Every  girl  felt 
like  one  of  these  sexist  labels 
described  her  at  some  point. 

So,  maybe,  every  girl  felt 
like  the  Duff,  too? 

“God,  I’m  late,”  Vikki 
said  as  the  tardy  bell  rang.  “I 
should  go.” 

I  watched  as  she  gathered 
her  purse  and  textbooks  off 
the  counter,  wondering  what 
was  going  through  her  head. 
Had  all  of  this  made  her 


realize  the  consequences  of 
her  choices? 

Our  choices. 

“See  you  around,  Bianca,” 
she  said,  moving  toward  the 
door. 

“Bye,”  I  said.  Then, 
without  meaning  to,  I  added, 
“And,  Vikki...  I’m  sorry.  It’s 
really  messed  up  the  way 
people  are  talking  about  you. 
Just  remember  that  what  they 
say  doesn’t  matter.”  Again,  I 


thought  of  Wesley  and  what 
he’d  said  to  me  in  his 
bedroom.  “The  people  who 
call  you  names  are  just  trying 
to  make  themselves  feel 
better.  They’ve  fucked  up 
before,  too.  You’re  not  the 
only  one.” 

Vikki  looked  surprised. 
“Thanks,”  she  said.  She 
opened  her  mouth  like  she 
might  say  something  else,  but 
then  closed  it  again.  Without 


another  word,  she  left  the 
bathroom. 

For  all  I  knew,  Vikki 
might  go  out  and  hook  up 
with  another  guy  that  same 
night.  She  might  not  have 
learned  anything  from  this 
experience.  Or  maybe  she’d 
change  her  behavior 
altogether — at  the  very  least, 
she  might  be  more  careful.  I 
might  never  know.  That  was 
her  choice.  Her  life.  And  it 


wasn’t  my  place  to  judge. 

It  was  never  my  place  to 
judge. 

And  as  I  walked  down  the 
hall,  five  minutes  late  for 
English,  I  decided  that  I’d 
think  twice  before  calling 
Vikki — or  anyone  else  for 
that  matter — a  whore  again. 

Because  she  was  just  like 
me. 

Just  like  everyone  else. 

That  was  something  we  all 


had  in  common.  We  were  all 
sluts  or  bitches  or  prudes  or 
Duffs. 

I  was  the  Duff.  And  that 
was  a  good  thing.  Because 
anyone  who  didn’t  feel  like 
the  Duff  must  not  have 
friends.  Every  girl  feels 
unattractive  sometimes.  Why 
had  it  taken  me  so  long  to 
figure  that  out?  Why  had  I 
been  stressing  over  that  dumb 
word  for  so  long  when  it  was 


so  simple?  I  should  be  proud 
to  be  the  Duff.  Proud  to  have 
great  friends  who,  in  their 
minds,  were  my  Duffs. 

“Bianca,”  Mrs.  Perkins 
greeted  me  as  I  walked  into 
the  classroom  and  took  my 
seat.  “Well,  better  late  than 
never,  I  suppose.” 

“Yeah,”  I  said.  “Sorry  it 
took  me  so  long.” 


When  I  got  home  that 


afternoon,  I  was  too 
exhausted  to  climb  the  stairs, 
so  I  collapsed  on  the  couch 
and  fell  into  a  nice  doze.  I’d 
forgotten  how  good  it  felt  to 
take  a  nap  in  the  middle  of 
the  day.  I  mean,  Europeans 
have  the  right  idea  with  their 
siestas.  Americans  should 
consider  adding  them  to  their 
daily  schedule  because 
they’re  incredibly  refreshing, 
especially  after  a  dramatic 


day  like  I’d  had. 

It  was  almost  seven  when 
I  woke  up,  which  didn’t  give 
me  much  time  to  get  ready 
for  my  date.  My  hair,  which 
looked  like  a  haystack  after 
snoozing  on  the  couch,  would 
take  almost  the  entire  hour  to 
repair.  Just  great. 

Since  I’d  started  dating 
Toby,  I’d  been  paying  more 
attention  to  how  I  looked.  Not 
that  he  cared  about  that  kind 


of  thing.  The  guy  probably 
would  have  said  I  was  pretty 
in  a  clown  suit — rainbow  wig 
and  all.  But  I  felt  this  constant 
need  to  impress  him.  So  I 
straightened  my  hair  and 
pulled  it  into  a  high  ponytail, 
put  on  a  pair  of  silver  clip-on 
earrings  (I’m  too  chicken  to 
get  any  piercings),  and  found 
the  shirt  Casey  had  given  me 
for  my  seventeenth  birthday. 
The  silky  material  was  white 


patterned  with  intricate  silver 
designs,  and  it  fit  me  tight  in 
the  chest,  which  made  my 
itty-bitty  boobies  appear 
somewhat  bigger. 

It  was  almost  eight 
o’clock  by  the  time  I 
struggled  down  the  stairs  in 
my  platform  wedge  sandals, 
risking  my  safety  for  the  sake 
of  looking  taller.  I  was 
careful  to  avert  my  eyes  when 
I  walked  past  the  kitchen 


because  Dad,  obviously 
thinking  the  roses  were  from 
Toby,  had  put  the  bouquet  in 
an  antique  vase  on  the  dining 
table  last  night.  It  was  a  sweet 
gesture,  but  seeing  the  bright 
red  flowers  only  brought  back 
the  annoying  questions.  So  I 
stumbled  into  the  living  room 
and  plopped  down  on  the 
couch  to  wait  for  my  date, 
promising  myself  that  I’d 
figure  out  my  romantic  mess 


sometime  over  the  weekend. 

For  lack  of  anything  better 
to  do,  I  picked  up  the  copy  of 
TV  Guide  that  was  lying  on 
the  coffee  table  and  began 
scanning  the  program 
schedule.  A  yellow  Post-it 
note  wedged  between  the 
pages  caught  my  attention, 
and  I  flipped  to  the  section  it 
was  marking.  Dad  had 
highlighted  a  Family  Ties 
marathon  for  the  following 


Sunday  night,  using  the  little 
slip  of  paper  as  a  bookmark.  I 
smiled  and  pulled  a  pen  out 
of  my  purse,  scribbling,  “I’ll 
make  popcorn,  ”  on  the  Post- 
it.  Dad  would  see  it  when  he 
got  home  from  his  meeting. 

Just  when  I  put  the 
magazine  back  on  the  table, 
the  doorbell  rang.  I  stood  up 
as  quickly  as  I  could  without 
falling  and  walked  over  to  the 
door,  expecting  to  be  greeted 


by  a  big  undeserved  Toby 
smile.  But  the  smile  that 
flashed  in  front  of  me,  while 
sparkly  and  white,  belonged 
to  someone  quite  different. 

“Mom?”  I  practically 
gasped  the  word,  sounding 
like  some  chick  in  a  soap 
opera  who’s  just  learned  her 
evil  twin  is  still  alive  or 
something.  Embarrassed,  I 
cleared  my  throat  and  said, 
“What  are  you  doing  here?  I 


thought  you  were  in 
Tennessee.” 

“I  was,  but  I  came  to  visit 
you,  of  course,”  my  mother 
replied,  cocking  her  head  to 
the  side  in  her  movie-star 
fashion.  Her  platinum  blond 
hair  was  pulled  into  a  neat 
clip  at  the  back  of  her  head, 
and  she  was  wearing  a  red- 
and-black  knee-length  dress. 
Typical  Mom. 

“But  it’s,  like,  a  seven- 


hour  drive,”  I  said. 

“Oh,  believe  me,  I  know.” 
She  sighed  dramatically. 
“Seven  and  a  half  in  bad 
traffic.  So. . .  are  you  going  to 
invite  me  in  or  not?”  I  could 
tell  by  the  way  her  hands 
twisted  around  the  strap  of 
her  handbag  that  she  was 
nervous  to  be  back  in  this 
house. 

“Urn,  yeah,”  I  said, 
stepping  aside.  “Come  in. 


Sorry.  But,  uh,  Dad’s  not 
here.” 

“I  know.”  She  was 
looking  around  the  living 
room  in  a  way  that  made  me 
feel  anxious  for  her.  She  eyed 
the  armchair  and  couch  that 
had  once  belonged  to  her  as  if 
debating  whether  she  was 
allowed  to  sit  there  now.  “He 
has  his  AA  meetings  on 
Fridays.  He  told  me.” 

“You  talked  to  him?”  This 


was  news  to  me.  As  far  as  I’d 
known,  my  parents  had  been 
avoiding  contact  since  Mom’s 
reappearance  last  month. 

“We’ve  spoken  on  the 
phone  twice.”  She  pulled  her 
eyes  away  from  the  furniture 
and  focused  them  on  me. 

They  felt  like  heavy  weights 
on  my  shoulders.  “Bianca, 
sweetie. . .”  Her  voice  was 
soft  and  sad.  Painful  to  hear. 
“Why  didn’t  you  tell  me  he 


was  drinking  again?” 

I  shifted,  trying  to  slide 
out  from  under  her  gaze.  “I 
don’t  know,”  I  mumbled.  “I 
guess  I  just  hoped  it  would 
pass.  I  didn’t  want  to  worry 
you  over  nothing.” 

“I  understand,  but  Bianca, 
this  is  a  serious  issue,”  she 
said.  “Y ou  know  that  now,  I 
hope.  If  it  ever  happens  again, 
you  don’t  get  to  keep  it  to 
yourself.  You  have  to  tell  me. 


Do  you  understand?” 

I  nodded. 

“Good.”  She  sighed, 
looking  immensely  relieved. 
“Anyway,  that’s  not  why  I’m 
here.” 

“Why  are  you  here?” 

“Because  your  dad  also 
told  me  something  else,”  she 
teased.  “Something  about  a 
boy  named  Toby  Tucker.” 

“You  drove  seven  and  a 
half  hours  because  I  have  a 


date?” 

“I  have  other  reasons  to  be 
in  Hamilton,”  she  said.  “But 
this  is  the  most  important.  So, 
is  it  true  my  baby  has  a 
boyfriend?” 

“Um,  yeah,”  I  said, 
shrugging.  “I  guess.” 

“Well,  tell  me  about  him,” 
Mom  urged,  finally  deciding 
to  sit  down  on  the  sofa. 
“What’s  he  like?” 

“He’s  nice,”  I  said. 


“How’s  Grandpa?” 

Her  eyes  narrowed 
suspiciously.  “He’s  fine. 
What’s  wrong?  You’re  taking 
your  birth  control,  aren’t 
you?” 

“God,  Mother,  yes,”  I 
groaned.  “That’s  not  the 
issue.” 

“Thank  the  Lord.  I’m  too 
young  and  hot  to  be  a  nana.” 

No  kidding,  I  thought, 
remembering  Vikki. 


“Then,  what’s  the 
problem?”  she  pressed.  “I 
came  because  I  heard  you  had 
a  hot  date  tonight,  and  I 
wanted  to  have  that  special 
Mommy  moment.  But  if 
you’re  having  problems,  I  get 
to  spill  out  some  Mommy 
advice,  too.  It’s  like  a  two- 
for-one  visit,  isn’t  it?  Makes 
the  travel  time  worth  it.” 

“Thanks,”  I  grumbled. 

“Oh,  honey,  I’m  kidding. 


What’s  wrong?  What’s  the 
matter  with  this  boy?” 

“Nothing.  He’s  absolutely 
perfect.  He’s  smart  and  nice 
and  totally  right  for  me.  Only 
there’s  another  guy. . .”  I 
shook  my  head.  “It’s  stupid. 
I’m  being  an  idiot.  I  just  need 
a  little  time  to  think  things 
over.  That’s  all.” 

“Well,”  Mom  said, 
standing  up.  “Just  remember 
to  do  what  makes  you  happy, 


okay?  Don’t  lie  to  yourself 
because  you  think  it’s  safer. 
Reality  doesn’t  work  like 
that. ...  I  think  I  told  you  that 
before.” 

She  had. 

But  I’d  been  running  for 
so  long  I  wasn’t  sure  what  I 
wanted  anymore. 

“Though,”  Mom 
continued.  “I  brought  you  a 
little  something  for  your  date, 
and  it  might  help  you  out 


while  you’re  thinking 
everything  over.” 

I  watched  with  mild 
horror  as  she  pulled  a  pink- 
and-yellow  box  from  her 
handbag.  Any  object  that 
came  wrapped  in  those  colors 
couldn’t  be  a  good  thing. 
“What  is  it?”  I  asked  as  she 
placed  the  box  in  my 
outstretched  hand. 

“Open  it  and  find  out, 
silly.” 


Sighing,  I  pulled  the 
hideous  bow  off  the  box  and 
flicked  open  the  lid.  Inside 
was  a  small  silver  chain  with 
a  little  white  metal  charm  in 
the  shape  of  a  B.  Like  the 
ones  girls  wear  in  middle 
school,  as  if  they’ll  forget 
their  own  name  or  something. 

Mom  reached  forward  and 
removed  the  necklace  from 
the  box.  “I  saw  it  and  thought 
of  you,”  she  said. 


“Thanks,  Mom.” 

She  put  down  her  handbag 
and  moved  around  to  stand 
behind  me,  pushing  my  hair 
aside  so  that  she  could  fasten 
the  chain  around  my  neck. 
“It’s  gonna  sound  corny,  so 
try  not  to  roll  your  eyes  at 
me,  okay?  But  maybe  this 
will  help  you  remember  who 
you  are  while  you’re  figuring 
things  out.”  She  moved  my 
hair  back  into  place  and 


stepped  in  front  of  me  again. 
“Perfect,”  she  said.  “You 
look  wonderful,  sweetie.” 

“Thank  you,”  I  said,  and 
this  time  I  really  meant  it. 
Seeing  her  made  me  realize 
just  how  much  I’d  missed  my 
mother. 

At  that  moment,  the 
doorbell  rang,  and  I  knew  it 
had  to  be  Toby.  As  I  reached 
for  the  knob,  I  felt  Mom  slide 
into  place  behind  me,  ready 


to  observe. 

Oh,  great. 

“Hey,”  I  said,  opening  the 
door  and  glancing  away  from 
Toby’s  blinding  smile. 

“Hi,”  he  said.  “Wow.  You 
look  beautiful.” 

“Of  course  she  does,” 
Mom  interjected.  “What  did 
you  expect?” 

“Mother,”  I  hissed, 
shooting  her  a  dirty  look  over 
my  shoulder. 


She  shrugged.  “Hello, 
Toby,”  she  said,  waving.  “I’m 
Gina,  Bianca’s  mother.  I 
know,  I  look  more  like  her 
sister,  right?” 

I  gritted  my  teeth.  Toby 
laughed. 

“Have  a  good  time,”  Mom 
said,  kissing  me  on  the  cheek. 
“I’m  going  to  pack  up  some 
of  my  things  that  are  still 
here,  but  I’m  talking  at  a 
retirement  center  in  Oak  Hill 


Sunday,  so  I’ll  be  staying  at  a 
hotel  for  the  weekend.  We’ll 
have  lunch  tomorrow  so  I  can 
get  all  the  details.” 

She  pushed  me  out  the 
door  before  I  could  argue 
with  this,  and  then  I  was 
alone  with  Toby  on  the  porch. 

“She’s  funny,”  he  said. 

“She’s  insane,”  I 
muttered. 

“What  kind  of  talks  does 
she  give?  She  said  she  was 


going  to  a  retirement  home?” 

“Oh.  She  wrote  a  self¬ 
esteem  book.”  I  glanced  back 
at  the  house,  watching 
through  the  window  as  Mom 
moved  past,  headed  for  the 
bedroom  she  used  to  sleep  in, 
prepared  to  pack  up  the  last 
few  things  she’d  left  behind. 
I’d  never  realized  the  irony 
until  that  moment.  For  the 
past  couple  months,  I’d  been 
struggling  with  my  own  self- 


esteem  while  my  mother 
coached  others  on  how  to 
improve  theirs.  Maybe  if  I’d 
talked  to  her,  it  wouldn’t  have 
taken  me  so  long  to  figure 
things  out.  “She  talks  to 
people  around  the  country 
about  learning  to  accept 
themselves.” 

“Sounds  like  a  fun  job,” 
Toby  said. 

“Maybe.” 

He  smiled,  wrapping  his 


arm  around  my  waist  and 
leading  me  off  the  porch. 

I  sighed  and  danced  out  of 
his  grip  as  I  let  myself  into 
the  car. 


27 


Casey  and  Jessica  were 
waiting  in  the  backseat  of  the 
Taurus.  Both  of  them  grinned 
mischievously  at  me  when  I 
climbed  into  the  passenger’s 
seat.  “Someone’s  dressing 
sexy,”  Casey  teased.  “I  gave 
you  that  shirt  nine  months 


ago.  Is  this  the  first  time 
you’ve  worn  it?” 

“Um,...  yeah.” 

“Well,  it  looks  good  on 
you,”  she  said.  “Looks  like 
I’m  the  Duff  tonight.  Thanks 
a  lot,  B.”  She  winked  at  me, 
and  I  couldn’t  help  but  smile. 
Casey  had  recently  taken  to 
using  Duff  as  a  word  of  her 
own,  molding  it  into  our 
casual  conversations.  At  first 
I’d  found  it  kind  of 


unsettling.  I  mean,  the  word 
was  an  insult.  It  was  horrible. 
But  after  the  revelation  I’d 
had  that  day  in  the  bathroom 
with  Vikki,  I  appreciated 
what  Casey  was  doing.  The 
word  was  ours  now,  and  as 
long  as  we  held  on  to  it,  we 
could  control  the  hurt  it 
inflicted. 

“It’s  a  messy  job,”  I 
teased.  “But,  hey,  someone’s 
gotta  do  it.  I  promise  to  be  the 


Duff  next  weekend.” 

She  laughed. 

“Are  you  wearing  a 
padded  bra?”  Jessica  blurted 
out,  apparently  unaware  of 
our  conversation.  “Your 
boobs  look  bigger.” 

There  was  a  long  moment 
of  silence,  and  I  suddenly 
realized  that  I  would  have 
been  safer  with  my  mother. 

Casey  burst  into  a  fit  of 
laughter  as  I  buried  my  face 


in  my  hands,  completely 
mortified.  Toby  didn’t  show 
any  reaction.  Thank  God.  If 
he  had,  I  might  have 
committed  suicide  right  there 
in  the  car.  Banged  my  head 
against  the  window  until  my 
brain  was  flattened  like  a 
pancake.  Instead  of 
snickering  or  glancing  at  my 
chest  to  see  if  Jessica  was 
right,  Toby  acted  like  boobs 
hadn’t  even  been  mentioned. 


He  just  stuck  the  key  in  the 
ignition  and  pulled  out  of  my 
driveway. 

Note  to  self,  I  thought. 
Murder  Jessica  when  there 
are  no  witnesses. 

Though,  in  a  weird  way, 
Toby’s  lack  of  reaction 
bugged  me.  Wesley  would 
have  made  a  joke.  He  would 
have  looked  at  my  chest,  of 
course,  but  then  he  would 
have  said  something.  He 


would  have  made  me  laugh. 
He  wouldn’t  have  just 
ignored  it  like  Toby. 

God!  Of  all  things,  this 
should  not  have  been 
something  that  bothered  me. 

“You  know,”  Casey  said 
when  she  was  finally  able  to 
stop  laughing.  “It  was  pretty 
cool  of  you  guys  to  invite  us 
along.”  She  smiled  at  me,  and 
I  knew  she  was  glad  to  be 
included.  “But  you  realize 


this  is  totally  going  to  min 
your  date,  right?” 

“How  so?”  Toby  asked. 

“Because  we  get  to  be 
your  chaperones!”  Jessica 
declared  with  way  too  much 
enthusiasm. 

“Which  makes  it  our  job 
to  put  a  stop  to  all  forms  of 
hanky-panky,”  Casey  added. 
“And  we’ll  enjoy  doing  it.” 

“Yep.” 

But  Toby  and  I  had  no 


need  to  worry.  The  minute  we 
got  inside  the  Nest,  my 
friends  took  off  for  the  dance 
floor,  flipping  their  hair  and 
shaking  their  butts  in  the 
usual  fashion. 

“It  looks  like  they’re  the 
ones  who  need  to  be 
chaperoned,”  Toby  chuckled 
as  he  led  me  to  an  empty 
booth. 

“That’s  usually  my  job,”  I 
said. 


“Do  you  think  they  can 
survive  if  you  take  a  night 
off?” 

“We’ll  see.” 

He  smiled  and  touched  my 
earring  with  his  fingertips. 
“The  band  won’t  start  for  half 
an  hour,”  he  said,  moving  his 
hand  down  my  neck  to  rest  on 
my  shoulder.  It  didn’t  do 
anything  for  me.  But  if 
Wesley  had  done  this,  trailed 
his  fingers  across  my  skin 


that  way,  I  would  have. . . 

“Do  you  want  me  to  get  us 
some  drinks  before  the  bar 
gets  too  crowded?” 

“Sure,”  I  said,  choking 
back  the  thought  of  Wesley. 
“I’ll  have  a  Cher — Diet 
Coke.” 

“Okay,”  he  said.  “I’ll  be 
right  back.”  He  kissed  me  on 
the  cheek  and  left  for  the  bar. 

People  were  spilling 
through  the  doors  of  the  club. 


There  was  always  a  bigger 
crowd  on  nights  when  a  band 
played.  A  few  eighth-grade 
girls  took  the  booth  behind 
me,  bragging  loudly  about 
how  they’d  pretended  to  be  in 
high  school  to  get  in.  A  junior 
and  one  of  his  friends  sidled 
past  me,  a  poorly  concealed 
beer  bottle  hanging  out  of  his 
baggy  jacket,  and,  for  a  split 
second,  I  caught  a  glimpse  of 
the  dark-haired  freshman 


Jessica  and  I  had  watched  at 
the  basketball  game  weeks 
ago.  She  walked  through  the 
door,  hand  in  hand  with  a 
cute  boy  I  didn’t  recognize. 
Even  from  my  distance,  I 
could  see  the  smile  on  her 
face.  She  looked  beautiful, 
and  I  knew  one  of  her  preppy 
blond  friends  was  being 
forced  to  fill  in  as  the  Duff  in 
her  absence.  Then  she  and  her 
date  were  gone,  swept  away 


by  the  crowd,  leaving  me 
with  an  inexplicable  smile  on 
my  lips. 

I  didn’t  know  what  kind  of 
band  was  supposed  to  be 
performing,  but  based  on  the 
number  of  kids  with  purple 
hair  and  lip  rings  who  were 
walking  in,  I  figured  I’d  be 
hearing  Emo  music. 

There  went  my  smile. 

Great.  Whiny  boys  with 
guitars.  So  my  style,  right? 


I  was  absentmindedly 
watching  the  flood  of  people 
when  he  appeared  among  the 
crowd.  At  first  I  didn’t  even 
notice.  He  was  with  Harrison 
Carlyle,  talking  casually  as 
they  pushed  their  way  toward 
the  bar.  It  was  easy  to  track 
his  movement.  He  stood  a 
few  inches  taller  than 
everyone  around  him,  he 
glanced  around  the  crowd 
with  more  confidence  than 


the  rest  of  our  classmates,  he 
walked  through  the  swarms 
with  more  grace  than  any 
normal  teenager  could 
manage,  and  my  eyes 
followed  him  without  my 
brain’s  consent. 

Halfway  to  the  bar, 
Wesley  turned  his  head  in  my 
direction.  His  dark  eyes 
locked  with  mine  for  an 
instant.  Shit.  I  looked  away, 
praying  he  hadn’t  noticed  me, 


even  though  I  was  sure  he 
had. 

“God,”  I  muttered, 
clenching  my  fist  under  the 
table.  “It’s  like  he’s 
everywhere.” 

“Who’s  everywhere?” 
Toby  asked,  taking  his  seat 
across  from  me  and  sliding 
my  glass  along  the  smooth 
surface  of  the  table. 

“No  one.”  I  took  a  sip  of 
the  Diet  Coke  and  tried  not  to 


make  a  face.  The  lack  of 
sugar  left  a  bad  taste  in  my 
mouth.  I  swallowed  and 
asked,  “What’s  the  name  of 
the  band  that’s  playing 
again?” 

“Black  Tears,”  he 
answered. 

Yep.  That  sounded  like 
Emo  shit  to  me. 

“Cool.” 

“I’ve  never  heard  their 
music,”  Toby  admitted, 


running  a  hand  over  his  bowl 
cut  blond  hair.  “But  people 
have  told  me  they’re  good. 
Plus,  they’re  about  the  only 
band  in  Hamilton.  It  seems 
like  everyone  else  who  plays 
here  is  from  Oak  Hill.” 

“Uh-huh.” 

I  shifted  uncomfortably  in 
my  seat,  conscious  of 
Wesley’s  eyes  on  me.  The 
way  they  crept  along  my  skin 
made  me  insane,  and  I  hoped 


that  Toby  wouldn’t  notice  me 
twitching.  He’d  probably 
think  I  was  on  crack  or 
something. 

“I  finished  Wuthering 
Heights I  said,  desperate  to 
start  a  conversation  that 
would  get  my  thoughts  off 
Wesley.  It  took  me  a  minute 
to  realize  this  was  definitely 
not  the  best  subject  for  that 
task. 

“Did  you  like  it?”  Toby 


asked. 

“Well,  it  gave  me  a  lot  to 
think  about.”  I  could  have 
slapped  myself.  Wasn’t  it  that 
damn  book  that  had  me  so 
freaked  out  in  the  first  place? 
Why  did  I  have  to  bring  it  up? 
But  it  was  too  late  to  change 
the  topic  now.  Toby  had 
jumped  into  a  full-on  book 
critique. 

“I  know.  I’ve  always 
wondered  what  made  Emily 


Bronte  choose  to  write  such 
unpleasant  characters.  I  mean, 
throughout  the  whole  book,  I 
just  thought  that  both 
Heathcliff  and  Linton  were 
such  bastards,  and  Cathy. . .” 

I  swirled  my  straw  in  my 
drink,  only  half  listening. 
Every  time  Toby  said 
Heathcliff,  my  eyes 
automatically  darted  over  his 
shoulder  to  glance  at  Wesley. 
As  always,  he  looked 


gorgeous,  wearing  jeans  and  a 
tight  white  T-shirt  beneath  a 
slightly  too  large  black  jacket. 
He  was  sitting  alone  at  the 
bar,  stretched  out  and 
casually  leaning  back  with 
both  elbows  on  the  bar 
molding.  Alone.  Not  a  single 
girl  clinging  to  him.  Hell, 
even  Harrison  had 
disappeared.  Joe  was  the  only 
person  close  enough  to  keep 
him  company,  and  he  seemed 


to  be  busy  with  a  herd  of 
thirsty  Goth  kids. 

Wesley’s  eyes  stayed 
fixed  on  me  the  entire  time. 
From  where  I  sat,  it  was  hard 
to  read  their  expression,  but 
they  never  wavered  for  a 
second.  Yeah,  it  was 
unnerving,  but  I  knew  that  I 
would’ve  been  disappointed, 
maybe  even  hurt,  if  I’d  found 
that  he’d  turned  away.  I 
actually  caught  myself 


checking  every  few  minutes 
to  see  if  he  was  still  watching 
me. 

“Bianca?” 

Startled,  I  focused  on 
Toby  again.  “Hmm?” 

“Are  you  all  right?”  he 
asked. 

My  fingers  had  been 
toying  with  the  little  B  charm 
around  my  neck  without  my 
realizing  it.  Immediately  I 
dropped  my  hand  to  my  side. 


“I’m  fine.” 

“Casey  warned  me  that 
you’re  probably  lying  when 
you  say  that,”  he  said. 

I  gritted  my  teeth  and 
searched  the  dance  floor  for 
my  so-called  friend.  She  was 
being  added  to  my  hit  list. 

“And  I  think  she’s  right,” 
Toby  sighed. 

“What?” 

“Bianca,  I  can  see  what’s 
going  on.”  He  glanced  over 


his  shoulder  at  Wesley  before 
turning  back  to  me  with  a 
little  nod.  “He’s  been  staring 
at  you  since  he  got  here.” 

“Has  he?” 

“I  can  see  him  in  the 
mirrors  over  there.  And 
you’ve  been  staring  back,” 
Toby  said.  “It’s  not  just 
tonight  either.  I’ve  seen  the 
way  he  looks  at  you  during 
school.  In  the  hallways.  He 
likes  you,  doesn’t  he?” 


“I...  I  don’t  know.  I 
guess.”  Oh  God,  this  was 
uncomfortable.  I  just  kept 
spinning  my  straw  between 
my  fingers  and  watching  the 
little  waves  that  appeared  on 
the  surface  of  my  drink.  I 
couldn’t  meet  Toby’s  gaze. 

“I  don’t  have  to  guess,”  he 
said.  “It’s  pretty  obvious. 

And  the  way  you  look  at  him 
makes  me  think  you’re  in 
love  with  him,  too.” 


“No!”  I  cried,  releasing 
my  straw  and  glaring  up  at 
Toby.  “No,  no,  no.  I  am  not 
in  love  with  him,  okay?” 

Toby  gave  me  a  small 
smile  and  said,  “But  you  do 
have  feelings  for  him.” 

I  couldn’t  see  any  sign  of 
pain  in  his  eyes,  just  a  touch 
of  amusement.  That  made  it  a 
lot  easier  to  give  him  an 
answer.  “Um,...  yeah.” 

“Then  go  to  him.” 


I  rolled  my  eyes  without 
meaning  to.  It  was  just  so 
automatic.  “Jesus,  Toby,”  I 
said,  “that  sounds  like  a  line 
out  of  a  bad  movie.” 

Toby  shrugged.  “Maybe, 
but  I’m  serious,  Bianca.  If 
you  feel  that  way  about  him, 
you  should  go  over  there.” 

“But  what  about — ?” 

“Don’t  worry  about  me,” 
he  said.  “If  you  want  Wesley, 
that’s  who  you  should  be  with 


right  now.  Dating  me  won’t 
make  your  feelings  for  him 
go  away. ...  I  should  know. 
Definitely  don’t  worry  about 
me,  Bianca.  The  truth  is,  I’m 
in  the  same  situation  as  you.  I 
just  didn’t  want  to  admit  it.” 

“How?” 

Now  Toby  was  the  one 
staring  at  his  drink,  nervously 
adjusting  his  glasses.  “I’m  not 
over  Nina.” 


“Nina?  Your  ex?” 


He  nodded.  “We  broke  up 
over  a  month  ago,  but  I  still 
think  about  her  a  lot.  I  really 
do  like  you,  so  I  thought  that 
if  we  dated,  maybe  I’d  forget 
about  her.  For  a  while  I  did, 
but...” 

“Well  then,  you  should 
call  her,”  I  said.  “Instead  of 
just  sitting  here  pouting,  you 
should  call  Nina  and  tell  her 
how  you  feel.  Tonight.” 

He  brought  his  eyes  back 


up  to  meet  mine.  “You’re  not 
angry?  You  don’t  feel  used?” 

“That  would  make  me  a 
huge  hypocrite  since  I  was 
kind  of  using  you,  too.  Even 
though  I  really  didn’t  mean 
to.”  I  slid  out  of  the  booth  and 
paused  to  steady  myself  on 
the  platform  shoes.  “And  for 
the  record,  if  Nina  doesn’t 
take  you  back,  she’s  a  moron. 
I  think  you’re  probably  the 
sweetest,  most  polite  guy  I’ve 


ever  met  in  my  life,  and  I’ve 
had  a  massive  crush  on  you 
for  years.  I  seriously  wish  you 
were  the  one  for  me.” 

“Thanks,”  Toby  said. 

“And  if  Wesley  breaks  your 
heart,  I  promise  to. . .  well,  I 
would  say  I’d  kick  his  ass, 
but  we  both  know  that’s 
physically  impossible.”  He 
frowned  down  at  his  skinny 
arms.  “So  I’ll  write  him  a 
strongly  worded  letter.” 


“Okay,”  I  snorted.  I 
leaned  across  the  table  and 
kissed  Toby  on  the  cheek. 
“And  thank  you.” 

He  gave  me  one  more 
perfect  smile,  one  I  would 
remember  for  the  rest  of  my 
life,  and  said,  “You’re 
stalling.  Hurry  up  and  go.” 

“Right.  Okay.  See  you  in 
class,  Toby.” 

“Good-bye,  Bianca.” 

I  took  a  long,  deep  breath 


to  calm  my  nerves  as  I  locked 
eyes  with  Wesley  again. 

Then,  with  a  weak  smile 
pulling  at  the  comers  of  my 
mouth,  I  began  to  push  my 
way  through  the  crowded 
club,  leaving  behind  the 
nicest  guy  in  the  world.  The 
familiar  techno  music  had 
stopped  playing,  and 
everyone  on  the  floor  stood 
around  waiting  for  the  band 
to  go  onstage.  I  had  to  zigzag 


between  their  stationary 
bodies,  no  one  being 
considerate  enough  to  step 
aside  for  even  a  millisecond. 

I  spotted  Casey  in  the 
crowd — her  blond  head 
towering  over  everyone  but 
the  boy  beside  her,  the 
basketball  player  she’d  been 
eyeing  for  weeks — and  I 
knew  she  wouldn’t  like  my 
decision.  In  her  head,  it  was 
Wesley’s  fault  I’d  neglected 


her.  She’d  be  upset  with  me. 
She  might  even  get  pissed. 
She’d  think  I  was  leaving  her 
behind  again.  I  would  just 
have  to  prove  her  wrong. 
Prove  to  her  that  Toby,  whom 
she  adored,  wasn’t  right  for 
me. 

When  I  was  about  three 
yards  from  the  bar,  a  sound 
filled  the  speakers,  but  it 
wasn’t  the  Emo  music  I  was 
expecting.  Instead,  a  screech 


of  feedback  assaulted  my  ears 
— and  totally  scared  the  shit 
out  of  me.  I  was  so  startled 
that  I  jumped,  which 
wouldn’t  have  been  a  big  deal 
in  any  other  shoes. 

My  foot  landed  on  the  side 
of  my  platform,  throwing  me 
completely  off  balance. 

Before  I  could  recover,  my 
ankle  gave  way  and  sent  me 
flying — face  first,  naturally — 
into  the  wooden  floor.  Fan- 


freaking-tastic! 

I  couldn’t  help  letting  out 
a  whimper  as  pain  shot 
through  my  twisted  ankle. 
“Fuck!”  I  groaned.  “Ow,  ow, 
ow!  God,  I  hate  these  damn 
shoes.” 

“Then  why  did  you  wear 
them?” 

My  skin  tingled  as  two 
hands  lifted  me  by  the  elbows 
and  guided  me  into  a  standing 
position.  Realizing  I  wasn’t 


stable  on  my  feet,  Wesley 
wrapped  his  arm  around  my 
waist  and  walked  me  over  to 
a  bar  stool. 

“Are  you  all  right?”  he 
asked,  helping  me  onto  the 
seat.  I  could  tell  by  his  smile 
that  he  was  fighting  the  urge 
to  laugh. 

“Yes,”  I  mumbled,  letting 
myself  smile  a  little.  I  didn’t 
really  feel  that  embarrassed. 
Not  with  Wesley.  Had  it  been 


anyone  else,  I  would  have  run 
— or  hobbled — right  out  of 
the  club,  but  with  Wesley  it 
felt  okay.  Like  we  could 
laugh  about  it  together. 

But  the  smile  faded  and 
his  face  became  serious.  He 
stared  at  me  for  a  long 
moment,  and  his  silence  was 
about  to  drive  me  up  the  wall 
when  he  finally  opened  his 
mouth.  “Bianca,  I — ” 

“Bianca!  Omigosh!” 


Jessica  materialized  at  my 
side,  her  cheeks  pink  from 
excitement  and  exercise. 
Behind  her,  the  band  had 
started  playing  (or  attempting 
to  play)  an  Emo  version  of  a 
Johnny  Cash  song.  It  was 
sickening,  but  Jessica 
managed  to  talk  over  the 
racket.  “Oh,  Bianca,  I  finally 
found  you!  Did  you  see? 
Harrison  and  I  were  dancing 
together!  I  think  he  might  ask 


me  to  prom.  Wouldn’t  that  be 
great?” 

“Good  for  you,  Jessica.” 

“I  have  to  go  tell  Angela!” 
Then  she  spotted  Wesley.  A 
knowing  smile  spread  across 
her  face  as  she  said,  “See  you 
two  later.”  And  with  a  whip 
of  her  blond  ponytail,  she  was 
gone. 

Wesley  watched  her 
vanish  into  the  crowd  with  an 
amused  expression.  “She 


does  know  Harrison  prefers 
men,  right?” 

“Let  her  have  hope,”  I 
said,  smiling  to  myself. 

He  turned  his  attention 
back  to  me.  “Yes.  Hope  is 
good.  Bianca,  I — ”  He 
grinned  wickedly.  “I  knew 
you’d  give  in  sooner  or  later.” 
He  put  his  hand  on  my  knee 
and  ran  it  smoothly  up  my 
thigh.  “You’re  finally  going 
to  admit  that  you  love  me, 


aren’t  you?” 

I  swatted  his  hand  away. 
“First  of  all,”  I  began,  “I 
don’t  love  you.  I  love  my 
family  and  maybe  even  Casey 
and  Jessica,  but  romantic  love 
takes  years  upon  years  to 
develop.  So  I  don’t  love  you. 
But  I  will  admit,  I’ve  thought 
a  lot  about  you  lately  and  I 
definitely  have  feelings  for 
you. . .  feelings  other  than 
hatred  for  the  most  part.  And 


maybe  it’s  possible — in  the 
future — that  I. . .  could  love 
you.”  I  hesitated,  a  little 
scared  of  the  words  that’d  just 
left  my  mouth.  “But  I  still 
want  to  kill  you  most  of  the 
time.” 

Wesley’s  grin  turned  into 
a  genuine  smile.  “God,  I’ve 
missed  you.”  He  leaned  down 
to  kiss  me,  but  I  held  up  my 
hand  to  stop  him.  “What’s  the 
matter?”  he  asked. 


“You’re  not  getting  into 
my  pants  tonight,  asshole,”  I 
said,  remembering  Vikki  and 
the  scare  she’d  gone  through. 

I  wasn’t  going  to  suddenly 
become  a  nun  or  anything, 
but  after  realizing  how  easily 
we  might  have  swapped  roles, 
I  knew  a  few  things  would 
have  to  change.  “If  we’re 
going  to  do  this,  we’re  going 
to  do  it  right.  We’re  going  to 
move  at  the  speed  of  a  normal 


high  school  relationship.” 

He  reached  forward  and 
touched  the  little  white  B  that 
lay  right  between  my 
collarbones,  twisting  the 
charm  that  Mom  had  given 
me  between  his  thumb  and 
forefinger,  almost 
absentmindedly.  “But  neither 
of  us  is  normal.” 

“That’s  true,”  I 
acknowledged.  “But  this  part 
of  us  will  be  normal.  Look, 


I’m  not  saying  we  can’t  build 
back  up  to  that  point.  We’ll 
just. . .  take  it  a  little  more 
slowly.” 

Wesley  thought  about  this 
for  a  moment  before  letting 
that  crooked  grin  slide  across 
his  lips  again.  “Okay,”  he 
said,  leaning  forward  a  little 
to  look  me  in  the  eyes. 
“That’s  fine.  There  are  other 
things  we  can  do.”  His 
fingers  released  my  necklace 


and  moved  across  my 
collarbone,  gliding  down  my 
arm  and  sending  a  shiver  up 
my  spine.  “I  have  a  job  to 
finish,  I  believe.  We  were 
interrupted  last  time — in  your 
bedroom — but  I  could  show 
you  again.  I  look  forward  to 
showing  you.” 

I  took  a  deep  breath, 
trying  to  ignore  this  statement 
and  the  burst  of  excitement  it 
gave  me.  “You’re  going  to 


take  me  on  dates,”  I 
continued,  clearing  my  throat. 
“Nice  dates.  And  you’re 
never  ever  going  to  call  me 
Duffy  again  either.” 

Wesley’s  smirk  faded  and 
he  bit  his  lip.  “Bianca,”  he 
said  quietly.  I  could  barely 
hear  him  over  the  music.  “I’m 
sorry.  I  didn’t  know  how 
much  it  hurt  you.  I  should 
never  have  called  you  the 
Duff  in  the  first  place.  I  didn’t 




know  you  then.  I  didn’t 
I  shook  my  head.  “Don’t 
bother  making  excuses,”  I 
said.  “Don’t  waste  your  time 
because,  the  fact  is,  I  am  the 
Duff.  But  so  is  everyone  else 
in  the  world.  We’re  all 
fucking  Duffs.” 

“I’m  not  the  Duff,” 
Wesley  said  confidently. 

“That’s  because  you  don’t 
have  friends.” 


“Oh.  Right.” 


“And,”  I  continued,  “I’m 
probably  going  to  be  a  bitch 
most  of  the  time.  I  guarantee 
I’ll  find  a  reason  to  yell  at 
you  almost  every  day,  and 
don’t  be  surprised  if  a  few 
drinks  get  dumped  on  you 
from  time  to  time.  That’s  just 
me,  and  you’re  going  to  have 
to  deal  with  it.  Because  I’m 
not  changing  for  you  or 
anyone  else.  And  I — ” 
Wesley  slid  off  his  bar 


stool  and  pressed  his  lips 
against  mine  before  the  words 
could  get  out.  My  heart 
pounded  as  every  thought 
vacated  my  mind.  One  of  his 
arms  encircled  my  waist, 
pulling  me  as  close  to  him  as 
possible,  and  his  free  hand 
cupped  my  face,  his  thumb 
tracing  my  cheekbone.  He 
kissed  me  so  passionately  I 
thought  we  would  catch  on 
fire. 


It  wasn’t  until  after  he 
pulled  away,  both  of  us  in 
need  of  some  air,  that  I  could 
think  straight  again. 

“You  jerk!”  I  yelled, 
pushing  him  away  from  me. 
“Kissing  me  to  make  me  shut 
up?  God,  you’re  so 
obnoxious.  I  could  just  throw 
something  at  you  right  now.” 

Wesley  hopped  onto  his 
bar  stool  with  a  big  grin,  and 
I  suddenly  remembered  him 


telling  me  that  I  was  sexy 
when  I  was  mad  at  him.  Go 
figure.  “Excuse  me,  Joe,”  he 
called  to  the  bartender.  “I 
think  Bianca  wants  a  Cherry 
Coke.” 

Despite  my  best  efforts,  I 
smiled.  He  wasn’t  perfect,  or 
even  remotely  close,  for  that 
matter,  but,  hey,  neither  was 
I.  We  were  both  pretty  fucked 
up.  Somehow,  though,  that 
made  everything  more 


exciting.  Yeah,  it  was  sick 
and  twisted,  but  that’s  reality, 
right?  Escape  is  impossible, 
so  why  not  embrace  it? 

Wesley  took  my  hand  and 
laced  his  fingers  with  mine. 
“You  look  beautiful  tonight, 
Bianca.”
