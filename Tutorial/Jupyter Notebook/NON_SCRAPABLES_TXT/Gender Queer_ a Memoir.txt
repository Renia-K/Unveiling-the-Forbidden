BY MORNING SOMETHING MAGICAL HAD 
HAPPENED. I HAD BECOME

A MUCH LESS WELCOME CHANGE 
WAS OUST AROUND THE CORNER. 


I feel

I couldn't see this new development 
as a reason to celebrate. 


FIIDING MY PERIOD BECAME 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. 


FOR TWo ENTIRE SCHOOL YEARS ZI SUCCESSFULLY 
AVOIDED EVER USING A ScHOoL BATHROOM.

NIGHTMARES INVOLVE MENSTRUAL BLOOD.

Sensation of fot blood 
gushing from my body— 


OF COURSE I NEVER HAVE A PAD OR CLEAN CLOTHES.

GIVE ME THE PERFECT EXCUSE 
TO HAVE MY BREASTS REMOVED. 


Since then there have been 
Several cases of cancer in 
my family, So L Know 
how terrible that 
Sounds. 


'd like to Say L NN

anymore... but that 
would not be true. 


THE BOYS AROUND ME SEEMED AS YET UNRAVAGED BY 


PUBERTY. WISHED I WAS ONE OF THEM.

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

Do you feel sad that you 
Weren't born with a dick ? 


NATURALLY, I RELAYED THIS WHOLE EXCHANGE 
TO ANOTHER (QUEER, FEMALE) FRIEND. 


- and then I guess I ended up coming out to 
him, Completely by accident,’ I just Said it. 


Kind of like how you've 
just Said it to me right now ?

I DECIDED TO TALK TO MY MOM ABOUT IT. 


I Know I told you ages ago that I am bi, but 1 
think now that I’m probably genderqueec too? 


But — like I’ve never felt 
female, or identified with 


Welt- I’m Still Sorting out 
what it means and how 


to explain it. 


Specifically things Uike— 
having breasts or having 
a period ... 


No one (ikes having 
their period. 


But L feel it goes deeper than that for me? M 
whole life Tye wished for a magical way to 


Switch between genders.

So that 


you could be

Sometimes ! 


You don't have to be 
Super-feminine to be a 
Woman — I’m not. 


Sort of, but not exactly. 
It'S more about NOT 
being female than 
BEING male. 


No, of course not. 
I hope you mah 
hate your body / 


But like... you don't hate 
having Oo Vagina, 


do You e 


149 


No, I don’t hate my body. 
I don't have Chronic 
pain or any of the 
other health issues 
So mony of 
my friends 
deal with. 


The majority of my 
body is great. There 
are just... a few bits 
I don't Like. 


For example, if I could just remove my entire 
reproductive System, that would be ideal. 


But what 
about having 
Kids ° 


I wish you wouldn't 
7 “— You'd be 


Uhhg, I've told you 
A HUNDRED TIMES, 
IL am NEVER having 
children / 


150 


No I wouldn't / Td be constantly resenting 
the kid for taking up all of my time / 


I'm WAY 
too selfish for 
parenting f 


Plus, the thought of growing a

modern dance at the time 
performances. 


Several days 
drivin 19 around 
San Francisco 
Scouting 

locations. 


s 


I ALSO SCROLLED THROUGH MANY “YES/NO/MAYBE” 
LISTS ONLINE, TRYING TO DECIDE IF My SHIPS WERE 
SEXUALLY COMPATIBLE (AS You DO). ONE DAY 
I FOUND THIS KINK DEFINED ON WIKIPEDIA: 


Wow. I never 
Knew there was 
a word for that. 


AU TOANDROPHILIA : 


Refers to a person 
assigned female at 
birth who 1S Sexuall 


aroused at the thought 
or image of having 
male genitalia or 
being @ man. 


L matched with 
Six women. 


I sent all of 
them a first 
message. 


Four of them responded. 


Two of those responses 
developed into conversations. 


Il asked if they Wanted to meet in 
perSon, and they both Said yes f 


SO I PICKED A TIME TO MEET 


CANDIDATE Y. 


She had come off as Shy in our 
messages. I tried to get a Sense 
of her hobbies, interests, and 
aspirations but she seemed 
hesitant to reveal them. 


159 


It soon became clear 
that every activity 
in her life revolved 
around alcohol. 


I waited 
because it 
WAS MY 

first ever 
date. 


Candidate 
arrived 

30 minutes 

late. 


Her dream was to get 
her bartending license. 


Her hobby was drinking ~ to 
blackout multiple times per week. 


Within 45 minutes 
it Seemed clear 
thot we had 
NOTHING IN 
COMMON]. 


The reason she 
was late was 
that She hod 
totalled her cac 
the night before. 


Which didnt stop her from asking 
if I wanted to go back to her place. 


Maybe 
She just wanted 
a ride back to 


her apartment.

PATRICIA S. CHURCHLAND 


THE SELF AS BRAIN 


Where in the 
physical structures of 
the brain are morality, 
empathy, aggression, free 
will and identity based 7 


a Nerve 


READING CHURCHLAND IS LIKE LISTENING 
TO AN ENGAGING UNIVERSITY LECTURE. 


Normally, when a sperm fertilizes an 
egg, the resulting human Conceptus 
has 23 pairs of Chromosomes 
[---] either XX (genetic female 

HowEVER : 


7 XY (genetic male). 1 in 650 born with XXY

In the early Stages of development, the sex organs aN 
(gonads) of the fetus are neutral, but during the second 

month of fetal development, genes on the Y Chromosome 
Produce proteins that transform the neutral gonads 
into male testes. Absent this action, the gonads grow 
into ovaries. (...] Testosterone produced by the 
fetal testes is released into the bloodstream 
and enters the growing brain. 


Smail but important 
Correction: once it passes 
from the blood into the 

brain, Some testoSterone tS 
transformed by an enzyme 
into a more potent 
androgen, dihydrotestos— 
terone. And some of that 
iS Changed into estradiol, 
which goes on to 


Paradoxical though it 
may Seem, estradiol, a 

female hormone, is Crucial 
to the masculinizing 
development . 


Biology is 


Masculinize 
the brain. 


CHURCHLAND, 
Ue 


Finally, the masculinizing 
of the gonads (making 
testes, penis, and 

prostate) occurs 
before the masculinizing 
of the brain. 


Sometimes the masculinizing 

of the brain does not 

follow the typical path 

and may be incomplete in 

Various ways. You could 

have male genitalia and 
a female brain. 


CHURCH AND, 137 


Once we Know Something about the many factors, 

genetic and otherwise, that can alter the | 
degree to Which a brain is masculinized, 
it is a little easier to grasp a 
biological explanation for 
how a person might feel 
a disconnect between 
his or her gonads and 
his or her gender 
identity.

Younger, but now they do. I know

I identify as gender 
nonbinary and I use 
the pronouns 
e,em, etr. 


I have a few things I 
want to explain before 
the exam. 


I have a lot of gender 
dysphoria around my 

genitals and I've been 
actively avoiding 

this exam 


for years. 


I’m going to use the smallest size 
Speculum and go as quickly as 


I can, alright ° 


The Speculum entering my body felt 
like a Knife being Shoved into my vagina. 
I Screamed and immediately Started 
Sobbing. The doctor quickly withdrew. 


I think this would be 
easier if You took a 


pain medication and 
moybe an anti- 
anxiety pill first.

I’m going to write you ao prescription and 
make you @ new appointment, okay? 


I'l leave So you can get 
dressed but I’li See you

So Short. Is starting

So far I’ve 
always decided 
it isn’t.
